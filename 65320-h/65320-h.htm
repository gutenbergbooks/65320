  <h2 class='c009'>PUBLISHERS’ NOTE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The Century Co.</span> counts itself fortunate
in being able to present to young readers an
admirable story from the Japanese, written by
one of Japan’s most popular novelists and
filled with the spirit of that great Oriental
nation. The author of this story, Gensai Murai,
was once a student of the Waseda School,
founded by Count Okuma, leader of the Progressive
Party in Japan. There he studied
English Literature as well as Japanese, and
after completing his course of study he was
employed by one of the well-known Tokio
daily papers, called the “Hochi,” to write stories
for it. His writings soon arrested the attention
of the reading circles in Japan. Several of his
novels went through as many as ten editions
within two years.</p>
<p class='c011'>This story of Kibun Daizin is founded upon
the life of Bunzayemon Kinokuniya, a Japanese
merchant of the eighteenth century, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>pluck, wisdom, and enterprising spirit made him
one of the most prosperous and respected men
of his time. He is much admired by his countrymen,
and is talked of familiarly, even to this
day, by the Japanese, under the nickname of
“Kibun Daizin.” “Ki” and “Bun” stand for
the initials of his personal and family names,
while “Daizin” means “the wealthiest man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The shrewdness and dauntless ambition of
the young hero of this story will commend him
to the admiration of American boys, and in
Kibun Daizin, as here pictured, they will find
a true representative of the wonderful nation
which, within thirty years, has entirely changed
the modes of life that it had followed for more
than twenty centuries, and has suddenly fallen
into line with the most civilized countries of the
world.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story was translated especially for <span class='sc'>St.
Nicholas</span>, and many quaint terms and expressions
have been purposely retained, although
the pronunciation and meaning of the Japanese
words are given wherever necessary.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced Dy-ko-koo’ya, meaning “dry-goods house.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am,” answered the gentleman,
eying the boy with surprise. “What can
I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I come from Kada-no-Ura,” said the
boy, making a polite bow, “and I wish to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>ask you a great favor. Will you please
take me into your shop as an apprentice?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your request is rather a strange one,”
said the gentleman, smiling. “Pray tell
me why it is that you wish to come to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy raised his head. “Oh, sir,
yours is the chief business house in Kumano,
and I would be so glad if I might
learn under you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You wish to become a business man,
do you?” said the gentleman, with a
friendly nod; upon which the boy drew
himself up and exclaimed, “Yes; I mean,
if I can, to become the leading merchant
in Japan!”</p>

<div id='i019'  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
<img src='images/i019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“‘If you please, sir, are you the head of the Daikokuya?’”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The master of the Daikokuya instinctively
studied the boy’s face. There was a
certain nobleness and intelligence about it;
he had well-cut features, a firmness about
the lips, and quick-glancing eyes, and,
although his clothing showed poverty, his
bearing was quiet and his speech refined.
These things confirmed the gentleman in
the opinion that the boy was not the son
of any common man; and having, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>employer of many hands, a quick eye to
read character, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good, my boy! So you mean
to become the leading merchant in Japan?
A fine notion, to be sure. However, before
I engage a boy, you know, I must
have somebody to recommend him, and he
must give me references. Have you any
relatives in this place?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; I know no one,” answered the
boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, where have you been until
now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have only just come from my country.
The fact is, I heard your name, sir,
some time ago, and being very anxious to
enter your service, I left my country all by
myself to come to Kumano. But I have
not a single acquaintance here, nor anybody
to whom I can turn. My only object
was to come straight to you; and I was
asking a man on the road if he could direct
me to your house, when the man pointed
to you and said, ‘Why, that gentleman
just ahead of us is the master of the Daikokuya.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>And that is how it comes that
I ran up to you all of a sudden in this rude
way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a charm in the free utterance
with which the boy told his story, and, having
listened to it, the gentleman said: “I
understand. It is all right. As you have
no friends here, I will do without a recommendation,
and you shall come just as you
are”; and, saying this, he brought the lad
back with him to his house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Daikokuya, you must know, was
the chief clothing establishment, or “dry-goods
house,” in Kumano, and did a larger
business than any other in the town. On
arriving there, the master took the boy
with him into an inner room, and, telling
his wife what had taken place, called the
boy to his side. “Tell me, my boy, what
is your name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My name is Bunkichi.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f2'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced Boon-kee’chee.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Are your parents living?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this question the boy hung his head
sorrowfully. “I have neither father nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>mother,” he answered, with a choking
voice and eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Filled with pity, the others asked him
how long he had been left alone in the
world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I lost my mother,” he said, “more
than three years ago, and my father only
quite recently.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what was your family? Were
you farmers or tradesmen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neither one nor the other. My father
formerly served under the Lord of Wakayama,
and received an allowance of eight
hundred <i>koku</i><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a> of rice. His name was
Igarashi Bunzayemon;<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a> but, losing his
position, he came to Kada-no-Ura, where
we had to live in a very poor way. My
father, however, would never allow me to
forget that the ancestor of our house was
Igarashi Kobunji,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a> who served in old days
at Kamakura, and gained a name for himself
as a brave warrior. ‘And when you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>become a man,’ my father used to say,
‘you must win your way to fame, and so
uphold the honor of the family; but, unlike
the past, our lot to-day is cast in peaceful
times when there is little chance of winning
distinction in arms; but become, if
you can, the leading merchant in Japan,
and you will bring honor to our house.’
Such was my father’s counsel to me, and
not long since he was taken with a severe
illness and died. And now, if you please,
I wish to learn the ways of business, that
I may become a merchant, and I have journeyed
to Kumano to throw myself on your
kindness.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f3'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One <i>koku</i> equals about five bushels.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f4'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced Ee-gar-ash’ee Boon-zy’e-mon.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f5'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced Ee-gar-ash’ee Ko-boon’jee.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The gentleman listened to the boy’s
clear account of himself and expressed his
admiration. “Ah! I was right, I see,
when I thought you were not the son of
an ordinary man. Your ambition to become
the chief merchant in Japan is a
high one, certainly; but the proverb says,
‘Ants aspire to the skies,’ and anything
is possible to a man who puts his whole
heart into his work. You are still quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>young, I should say, though you have
come all the way from Kada-no-Ura by
yourself, and though you talk of your affairs
in a manner that would reflect credit
on a grown-up man. Come, tell me, how
old are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am fourteen,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, not more than that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the master’s wife, who was by his
side, could not repress her surprise, either.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this point the <i>shoji</i>, or paper sliding
doors, opened, and in ran a pretty little
girl of about eleven. Her hair was drawn
up into a little butterfly device on the top
of her head, which shook to and fro as she
ran up to her mother. Stretching out a
small maple-leaf hand, with a winsome
look, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, please give me a cake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, my dear, where are your manners?
What will our young friend here
think of you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this the child looked around, and, for
the first time becoming aware of the boy’s
presence, turned shy and sat down. Looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>gently in her face, her mother then
asked her what she had been doing.
Afraid of the stranger, she whispered in
her mother’s ear: “I have been playing
<i>oni</i><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a> with Sadakichi in the garden. But
I don’t like Sadakichi. When he was the
<i>oni</i> he just caught me at once.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f6'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A play similar to tag or prisoner’s base.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“But that often happens in playing
<i>oni</i>,” said the mother, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but he does it too much; he has
no right to catch people in the way he does,
and I don’t wish to play with him any
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if that is so, how would you like
to play with Bunkichi here instead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Accepting it as one of the duties that
might fall to him, to act as the child’s companion
and caretaker, Bunkichi, rather
pleased than otherwise, offered to go out
and try to amuse her. The little girl
looked into her mother’s face, and then at
Bunkichi. “Mama, how long has he been
here?” she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He only came to-day, but he’s a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>boy, and I hope you’ll be a good little girl
and show him the garden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the child’s thoughts seemed suddenly
to take a new turn, and, sidling up
to her mother, she begged to be given a
cake. The mother opened the little drawer
of the <i>hibachi</i>,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c018'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and, taking out two or
three sugar-plums, put them into her hand.
The child then, with barely a glance at
Bunkichi, ran through the <i>shoji</i> out of
doors.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f7'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced he-bah’chee. A wooden fire-box where a
charcoal fire is kept for warming the hands.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Take care and don’t stumble,” her
mother called out. “Do you mind just seeing
after her?” she said to Bunkichi, who
at once got up and went out on the veranda.</p>

<p class='c011'>No sooner was Chocho Wage,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a> or
“Butterfly Curls” (so named from the
way in which her hair was dressed), outside
in the garden than she began quarreling
with the boy from the shop. “No,
Sadakichi; I’m not going to play with you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Mama says that the other boy who has
just come is a fine boy, and I’m going to
play with him.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f8'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced Cho’cho Wah’gay.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“What! another boy has come, has
he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; there he is. Go and fetch him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sadakichi called to Bunkichi, “You will
find some <i>geta</i><a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c018'><sup>[9]</sup></a> there, if you will come
out.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f9'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced gay’tah. Foot-wear or wooden clogs.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>So Bunkichi came out to the garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not a very large one, but it was
a pretty spot, for beyond it sparkled the
bay that lay at the back of Kumano. Bunkichi
had soon joined the two others, and
Sadakichi, turning to the little child, said,
“Well, shall we three play at <i>oni</i>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” she answered; “you are always
catching me, and I don’t care to play.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t catch you, then, Chocho, if you
don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All the same, I’d rather not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A thought struck Bunkichi, and, addressing
himself to the child, he said:
“Would you like me to make you something?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>I would if I only had a knife and
some bamboo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The child was at once interested, and
told Sadakichi to go and get what was
wanted. So Sadakichi strolled off and
brought a knife and some bamboo chips.
“Now, then, what are you going to
make?” said he.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A nice bamboo dragon-fly,” Bunkichi
answered; and, taking the knife, he split a
bit of the bamboo, shaved it fine and
smooth, and fixed a little peg in the middle
of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sadakichi, quickly guessing what it was,
said: “Ah, it’s a dragon-fly. I know! I
once went with the <i>banto</i><a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c018'><sup>[10]</sup></a> to Kada-no-Ura,
and every one there was flying those
dragon-flies, and, now I think of it, the
boy who was selling them looked just like
you.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f10'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Clerk.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Not a bit disconcerted, Bunkichi replied:
“Yes, you are quite right. I was
the boy who made them and was selling
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Bah! Mr. Dragon-fly-seller!” blustered
out Sadakichi, with a face of disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t speak like that,” said the little
girl, turning sharply upon him, and then
to Bunkichi: “What made you sell
them?” she asked, speaking out to him for
the first time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father was ill in bed,” he answered,
continuing to scrape the bamboo,
“and, as our family was poor, I managed
to buy him rice and medicine by selling
these dragon-flies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Child as she was, this touching story of
filial piety made her respect Bunkichi all
the more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wasn’t that good of him!” she
said, turning to Sadakichi. “Do you
think you could have done it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—yes; only there would have been
no need for me to sell dragon-flies. I
should have sold the wearing-things in
our shop,” he answered, arrogantly.</p>

<div id='i031'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“‘Why, it’s just like a real dragon-fly!’ she cried, with delight”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi had now finished making the
dragon-fly, and, holding it between his
hands, he spun it round, and up it went into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the air with a whirring sound, and lighted
on the ground again some five or six paces
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, it’s just like a real dragon-fly!”
cried the child, with delight. “Do let me
have it!” And, taking it in her hands, she
tried to set it flying, but she could only
make it go up a little way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Sadakichi, wishing to try his
hand, pushed forward. “Let me have it,”
he said, “and I’ll show you how well I
can do it”; and, seizing hold of it, with the
force of both hands he sent it flying high
into the air. “There, now—see how it
goes!” and, while the little girl was watching
it with delight, the dragon-fly flew
over the wall fence and dropped into the
water beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little child ran after it, followed by
Sadakichi and Bunkichi. There was a little
gate in the garden, opening on a jetty.
Through this they passed and stood together
on the plank, watching the dragon-fly
tossing about on the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I wish we could get it,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>little girl, looking at it wistfully; “if it
would only come just in front of us!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take care,” said Sadakichi, holding
her back, while the dragon-fly, bobbing up
and down among the ripples, gradually
drifted farther off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now Bunkichi, seeing there was a small
boat lying alongside the jetty, had said to
Sadakichi, “Let me row out and get it,”
and was drawing the boat toward him,
when he was abruptly stopped by Sadakichi.
“No, no; you mustn’t think of putting
out from the shore. If you do, you
are certain to be eaten up by the <i>wanizame</i>.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c018'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f11'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced wah-ne-zah’may, meaning a huge shark.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it’s quite true,” chimed in the
little girl. “There’s a horrid <i>wanizame</i>
that prevents any one going on the sea.
Only yesterday it captured somebody.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes—a young man from the brewery,”
said Sadakichi. “He had some barrels
in his boat, and he had gone only two
or three hundred yards when the shark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>came up and overturned his boat and
seized him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It doesn’t matter about the dragon-fly;
I don’t want it; let us go back to the
house.” And the little child, frightened in
good earnest, took hold of Bunkichi’s arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the first time Bunkichi had heard
about the <i>wanizame</i>. “Is it really true,
miss, that there is a <i>wanizame</i> in the
bay?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; I can tell you it’s very serious.
I don’t know how many people it has eaten
in the last month.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Really! But how big is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know what you would call
big,” broke in Sadakichi. “But it’s about
as big as this house. If it sees a small
boat, it overtakes it in no time and topples
it over, and if it is a big boat it gets
in the way and stops it so that it can’t
move, and so the fishermen can’t go out,
and no cargo can come into the port. I
suppose it must be want of food that has
brought it into this harbor; but, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>that may be, it thinks nothing of upsetting
the small craft, so that for a month no one
has ventured out at all. Well, there was
the brewer’s man. Yesterday he thought
it would be safe to go just a short distance,
but he very soon got swallowed up.
And what is the consequence? Why, the
fishing is stopped, and there’s no trade,
and the place is going to ruin. The fishermen
and hunters have tried over and over
again to kill it with spikes and guns and
with all kinds of things. But what is the
use? Their weapons only snap in two or
glance off its back, and they only get killed
themselves. So they have given up trying.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi listened to every word, and
then suddenly went into the house and
stood before the master.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE master and his wife were
engaged in conversation, but
on seeing Bunkichi the merchant
said, “Well, have you
been to see the garden?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, I have enjoyed it very
much,” answered Bunkichi, politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, bless me, he has all the manners
of a little <i>samurai</i><a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c018'><sup>[12]</sup></a>!” exclaimed the master
to his wife. “There is no comparison
between him and the other boys. But
dancing attendance on a little girl is not
the sort of employment for a lad who has
the ambition to become the leading merchant
in Japan. No, no; he wants to get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>into the shop as soon as he can and learn
the ways of business—eh, my boy?”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f12'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced sahm’oo-rye. The <i>samurai</i> were the military
class of Japan, corresponding to the knights of the middle
ages in European countries.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The master exactly interpreted Bunkichi’s
wishes, and Bunkichi felt very grateful
to him, but he only answered: “I shall
esteem it a great favor to be allowed to
serve you in any way. But, master, with
your leave, I would ask you: Is it true,
as I hear, that there is a <i>wanizame</i> lately
come into this bay, and that people are
suffering a lot of harm from it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, me! Yes, it’s a sore trouble, that
<i>wanizame</i>; our fishermen are doing nothing,
our boat traffic is stopped, and if
things go on in this way the place will be
ruined. All sorts of attempts have been
made to kill it, but, alas! all to no purpose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then respectfully, in a kneeling posture,
approaching nearer, Bunkichi thus addressed
his master: “Master, in the request
I am now going to make of you, I
fear you will put me down as a child with
a vain, childish notion of doing great
things; none the less, I am bold to ask you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>in all seriousness, will you give me leave
to attempt the destruction of this <i>wanizame</i>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master exclaimed in astonishment:
“What! You think that you are going
to kill the <i>wanizame</i>? It would be the
greatest thing in the world if you could,
but already every means has been tried.
Whaling-men have tried to kill it with
their harpoons, the hunters of wild game
on the mountains have tried to shoot it
with their guns; but the <i>wanizame</i> has
defeated all their schemes, and, to say
nothing of the money it has cost, several
men have lost their lives in their attempts
to kill it, and our citizens have given it
up as hopeless. Son of a <i>samurai</i> though
you may be, this is no task for a boy of
thirteen or fourteen. No; you may have
seen in the seas around Kada-no-Ura
sharks of four or five feet in length, but
just go out to the hill above the town and
look over the bay until you catch sight of
our monster. The very sight of it is
enough to terrify most people.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“You mistake me, master,” said Bunkichi,
sitting up straight. “I have no
thought of trying my strength against the
<i>wanizame</i>. But I have a trick in my mind
I should like to play, if you would allow
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it’s a trick, is it? And what is
the trick our crafty youngster is going to
propose for killing the <i>wanizame</i>, I should
like to know?” said the master, smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The plan I have is simply this: First,
to make a straw figure and to fill up the
inside with poison. Then I shall dress it
in a man’s clothes and take it out into
the bay, and, when we see the shark coming,
throw it out to him to eat. Sharks
are senseless creatures and ready to eat
anything, so he is sure to swallow the
straw man, and if he does the poison will
at once take effect and kill him. That’s
my plan; what do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; I think your plan of making a
straw man is not at all a bad one, and I
have little doubt, as you say, that the shark
would swallow it. In that case it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>certainly die and we should be free at
last from our great calamity. But wait
a minute; I am afraid, when the doll is
made, there is nobody who will venture to
take it out to the sea. People have had so
many bitter lessons from trying to kill this
shark that, however much money you offer,
no one, I fear, will agree to take it
out into the bay.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi without any hesitation replied:
“I will undertake the task of taking
the doll out for the shark to swallow.
As I grew up by the seaside at Kada-no-Ura,
I can row a boat well and can swim
better than most people. I saw a boat just
now fastened at the jetty in your garden.
Please lend it to me and I will go out alone
upon the bay.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Astonished by the audaciousness of the
lad, the master said: “It is too wild an
idea, my boy. What if the shark upsets
your boat? He will swallow you up in an
instant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As to what you say about drowning,
that doesn’t disturb me at all. Suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>I have no luck and lose my life, there is
nothing to be regretted if by my death I
succeed in removing the great calamity
under which many are now suffering.
And, as I said before, it is my determination
to become the leading merchant of
Japan; but if I am to realize my ambition
I must be prepared to run many risks. If
fortune favors me I shall come safe
through them and attain my object; if,
however, this first venture goes against
me, and I go out to sea and fall a prey to
the <i>wanizame</i>, it simply means that I must
accept it as the decree of fate, and, as far
as my life is concerned, I am quite ready
to risk it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master, who was much struck by
his fearless determination, worthy of the
boy’s descent, said to him, “Indeed, your
magnanimity is greater than ours, but for
that very reason we should be all the more
sorry to lose you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Saying this, he turned round to his wife,
who whispered in his ear: “I quite agree
with you: if he be swallowed up by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>shark, we couldn’t possibly get another
like him; send some other one instead!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then in came the girl, attended by
Sadakichi, who had long been waiting for
the boy, and said, “Bunkichi, please be
quick and make me another dragon-fly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her mother, however, at once stopped
the girl, saying: “Come, come; Bunkichi
has something else to think about besides
dragon-flies: he’s just saying that he
wants to go out to sea and kill the <i>wanizame</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl was startled, for she was only
a child. “Does he go alone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that is what he says he will do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t, please, mother; I don’t like your
sending him to sea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, my child?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want him to make me a bamboo
dragon-fly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His curiosity aroused at hearing the little
girl speak of the dragon-fly, the father
said, “What do you wish him to make for
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, father, it’s a bamboo dragon-fly—an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>amusing toy which flies up high,
whizzing,” was her confident answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, I see,” he remarked, as he understood
the girl’s request; “that flying bamboo
thing I often see when I go out on
the streets. The toy, I remember, was first
made by a boy of great filial virtue in a
certain country district, and even here they
talk about him; it is clever of you, Bunkichi,
to have learned how to make them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Sadakichi interrupted, saying:
“No wonder! Why, he was the hawker
of the toy; I know all about it, as I saw
him selling it at Kada-no-Ura.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you, then, the inventor of the
toy?” asked the master, to whom the boy
at once replied in the affirmative. The
master, who was more than ever struck
by the boy’s character, said, “Are you,
then, the same boy whom all the people
talk about and praise for his devotion to
his parent?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the girl, who remembered what
had been told her a little while before, said:
“Father, his family was very poor, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>as his father was laid up on his sick-bed,
he sold those dragon-flies and bought
medicine or a little rice for the family.
He told me so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As she was listening to this conversation,
tears stood in the mother’s eyes, and
she said: “He is really a model boy, is he
not? I can’t possibly let him go to sea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master, who was much of the same
way of thinking as his wife, answered,
“Of course, I have been persuading him
to give up his idea”; and, turning to Bunkichi,
said, “Yes, do give it up, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the girl, seemingly with the intention
of inspiring the boy with dread and
deterring him from his purpose, remarked
solemnly, “Oh, it is dreadful to be swallowed
by the shark on going to sea!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, having once determined, was
immovable. “Sir, trading to a merchant
is the same that fighting is to a knight. It
has been ever regarded honorable in a
knight that he should hazard his life many
a time, even in his early youth. If fate be
against him, he will be put to death by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>enemy. The knights of old faced the dangerous
issues of life or death as often as
they went out to battle. As they attained
to renown by passing through these ordeals,
so, too, must the merchant who
aspires after a leading position not shrink
from braving many dangers in his life.
Sir, methinks the present is the opportunity
given me to try my hand; and if fate
sides with me and I succeed in killing the
<i>wanizame</i>, in future I shall have courage
to venture out on other great undertakings.
If one begins to be nervous at the
outset, one will go on being nervous forever;
but there is no fear, I think, for a
man who is ready to sacrifice even his own
life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master, meeting with such unflinching
determination, knew not how to
stop him, but said: “I must confess you
have more in you than I thought. I am
ashamed of myself to be thus taught by
you the secret of success in trade when I
should be in a position to teach you. Well
said, my boy; trading is to a business man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>what fighting is to a knight. If you begin
by being weak and timid, you will never
be capable of bold enterprise. If you have
a mind to divine your future by embarking
on this exploit, go in for it with all your
might. As to the preparations for making
the straw man, as far as buying the
poison is concerned, I will do it all for you.
You had better go up to the mountain
yonder, and ascertain the place where the
shark is generally to be seen coming up
to the surface. You, Sadakichi, had better
take him up to the Sumiyoshi<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c018'><sup>[13]</sup></a> bluff,
and point him out the monster if it should
come up and show itself on the surface of
the water in the mouth of the harbor.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f13'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced Soo-mee-yo’shee.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, who was much delighted at
having gained his wish, said: “Then, sir,
please let an apothecary prepare a lot of
drugs which are likely to be the best poison
for a <i>wanizame</i>, and I will go and have a
lookout for the appearance of the monster.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he was about to start, the girl asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>him, in a little voice of remonstrance,
“But when will you make a dragon-fly for
me, Bunkichi?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I come back, miss,” was his reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, come; he can’t be bothered
about such a trifle now,” said her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the two lads, Bunkichi and
Sadakichi, hand in hand, went up to the
Sumiyoshi bluff, which stood just outside
the town on the eastern side of Kumano
Bay. The mountain rose precipitously
from the sea, whose fathomless water
washed its southern base. A thick forest
of pines covered the mountain, and the
vibrating of their needle foliage in the
breeze added a strange harp-like accompaniment
to the perpetual roaring of the
waves below. On reaching the summit,
Bunkichi threw himself down on a knotty
root of pine near the edge of a precipice
and gazed out on the broad expanse
of Kumano Bay. As far as his view
reached, no shore could be descried; only
the line where the dome of the azure sky
circled the deep blue of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>After sitting thus in silent contemplation
for a few minutes, Bunkichi suddenly
turned round and said to Sadakichi: “Sea
scenery is always fine to look at, isn’t it?
I am fond of this sort of rough sea. I
should like to have a swim in it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t talk such nonsense; you would
no sooner get into it than you would be
swamped,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s just what I like. I should dive
deep down into the water and get out of
the whirlpool. And now, tell me where it
is the <i>wanizame</i> generally pops out its
head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It generally comes out just below this
headland,” the other answered, “at the
mouth of the harbor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the two boys were steadily gazing on
the surface of the water, sure enough, up
came the shark, and startled Sadakichi by
cleaving the water with its back. Whether
it was in frolic or in quest of prey, the
monster swam to and fro, now showing its
head and now its tail. Its rock-like back
and its iron-like fins were horrible enough
to inspire even men with awe.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Sadakichi, feeling nervous at the sight,
said to his companion, “Bunkichi San,
now you see the monster, you will be for
giving up your grand job, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! You don’t suppose I’m frightened,
do you,” was his scornful retort, “at
the sight of such a little fish?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you say?” said the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if the chance came in my way, I
might even kill a leviathan or a crocodile!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As these two were thus talking, a gust
of wind from the high Nachi Mountain
swept down on the forest of Sumiyoshi
and awakened the myriad tiny harps of the
pines, while the waves rolled one after
another against the rocks below. These
sounds combined to drown the voices of the
lads, one of whom seemed to be persuading
the other that it was time to go back, while
the other seemed to be insisting on staying
a little longer to enjoy the wild scenery
and to think over the issues of his scheme.</p>

THE master of the Daikokuya,
who had been much struck by
the wisdom and courage of
Bunkichi, lost no time in
going to an apothecary to get plenty of
the poisonous stuff for the <i>wanizame</i>,
while he ordered some of his men to prepare
the straw dummy.</p>

<p class='c011'>In course of time the two lads, Bunkichi
and Sadakichi, came back from Sumiyoshi
bluff. The master welcomed them
into his own room, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How now, Bunkichi? Did you see
the shark?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir, I saw it,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now that you have seen the monster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>are you less disposed to go out to
sea?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; on the contrary,” replied the lad,
“I am the more ready to go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t that obstinacy on your part?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not in the least, sir,” the lad said, as
he drew himself up; “the greater the opponent,
the greater the interest and
strength that are called for; and I am
about to do this at the risk of my life. I
well observed the spot where the shark
comes up, and noticed a large pine-tree
which projects over the sea from the
precipice. If some one will let fall a stout
rope from one of its branches, I will row
over to it, and there I shall entice the
shark to swallow the straw dummy; then
if the shark, in plunging about, should
upset my boat, I shall take hold of the
rope and climb or be hauled up the precipice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master, who was once more struck
by words which showed so much sagacity
as well as courage, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s a very good idea of yours.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Then this is what we shall decide to do,
is it? I shall send out some of my young
men to the Sumiyoshi bluff to fix a rope
to the pine branch from the precipice, and
you will tie the rope to your waist before
you go out on your venture. I and others
will stand upon the cliff and watch you,
and should you be in danger of being
swallowed by the monster, we shall lose
no time in hauling you up. Is that to be
our plan of action?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s the plan,” was the boy’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, I have bought the poison,
and can soon have ready as many as three
dummies. When do you think of setting
out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, at once,” answered Bunkichi.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is rushing it too quickly, my lad.
Wouldn’t it be better for you to wait
till to-morrow?” remonstrated the master.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless things of this kind are done
quickly and made easy work of, some obstacles
may arise and frustrate our plans;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>so I will just do it with as little concern as
you snap your fingers,” said the lad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can’t do things so lightly as you
say,” was the master’s reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>And his wife, who had been listening,
and who regretted having given her consent
to the boy’s rash project, added:
“Bunkichi, do stay at home to-day and
spend it in preparation and do the work
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the little girl also said: “I don’t
care for your going to sea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Bunkichi, having once made up his
mind in the matter, was not to be moved
by any one’s entreaties.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, by your leave, sir,” he said,
“I will take that little boat at the jetty.”
And without more delay he rose up to
go.</p>

<p class='c011'>His master knew not how to stop him,
but said: “No, no; that small boat is dangerous;
and, if you must go, you had better
go out in the <i>temmabune</i>.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c018'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f14'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pronounced Tem-mah-bonn’ay. A larger boat.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir,” said the lad; “the <i>temmabune</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>is too big for me to row alone, so I
prefer the small one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I am in great concern about your
personal safety if you go alone,” said the
master. “I will give ten <i>rio</i> to any one
who will go with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Though he quickly made known this
offer to the members of his household as
well as among his neighbors, no one ventured
to offer himself on account of the
people’s repeated and terrible experiences.
Bunkichi soothed his master, saying that
he was much freer if left to act by himself
than he would be if there were others
with him. Quickly putting the three dummies
into the small boat outside the garden
gate, with marvelous coolness, as if
he were going out for pleasure, he said:
“Good-by, everybody; I will go now, and
be back again soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master, who was first to stir, led
out to the jetty some of his young men
as well as some strong coolies. Three or
four big ropes having been made ready,
he said:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Now, Bunkichi, tie one of these to
your waist.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s no use, sir, till I get near the
mountain,” replied the lad, but the master
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But just think, if on your way out
the shark should turn up! We shall pull
you along the coast while you will row
as near as you can to the land.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, who couldn’t resist the master’s
persuasion, let him tie the rope round
his waist, and the master himself took
hold of the end of it and together with
others went along the shore toward Sumiyoshi
bluff.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, having been brought up at
the seaside, was an excellent rower, but
as they pulled along the rope he rowed
but slightly. Suddenly he took out a dagger
which had been handed down from
his ancestors and unsheathed it, smiling as
he noted the temper of the steel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who spread the news no one knew, yet
the people in the town came out in a
crowd, and every one was surprised to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>a boy, alone in a boat, sallying forth to kill
the monster.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t he a wonderfully courageous
boy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is no common boy. Perhaps he
may yet be as famous as our great hero
Kato Kiyomasa.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c018'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t he cool!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hasn’t he wonderful presence of
mind!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such expressions as these escaped from
everybody’s lips. Thus praising him as
they went along, the crowd followed the
master.</p>

<p class='c011'>From among the crowd an old woman
stepped out with a rosary in one
hand and said to the master:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, please let me hold the rope,
<i>Namu-Ami-Dabutsu</i>.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c018'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f16'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An expression used in one of the Buddhistic prayers.
Among a certain class of Japanese it was believed that by repeating
this phrase frequently their chances of going to heaven
were increased.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The young men turned to her and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ill omen! Don’t say such a thing as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><i>Namu-Ami-Dabutsu</i>. This is not the
rope for you to pull.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of the taunt she still muttered
the sacred charm of the Buddha sect, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But do let me hold it. I am the leader
in pulling timbers for the repairing of the
Hongwanzi<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c018'><sup>[17]</sup></a> temple. Yet I must have
my share, because I am sure that the lad
is a hero sent by Buddha himself to save
us from our troubles. <i>Namu-Ami-Dabutsu</i>,”
repeated the woman.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Just then a maid-servant carrying a little
girl on her back came along the shore
after the woman. The latter turned to the
little girl and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, you are the daughter of the Daikokuya.
Do you want to pull this rope,
too? <i>Namu-Ami-Da—</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl wouldn’t listen to her words,
but, looking intently at the boat in the distance,
called out aloud, “Bunkichi!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The other bystanders, who heard the
name for the first time, said: “Ah, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>name is Bunkichi, is it?” and at once
shouted, “Bunkichi Daimiozin,” which is
a title they give to the gods.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lad, taking little notice of the stir
on the shore, soon came to the foot of the
bluff. The master and others went up
the hillside along the edge of the precipice,
while the lad began to prepare for
his task.</p>

<p class='c011'>The long summer day was already declining
and a cool breeze from the far
ocean blew about his broad sleeves, and
the voice of the crowd grew fainter and
fainter as, hidden by the pine-trees, they
wound their way up to the top of the hill.
Yet now and then Bunkichi heard his
master’s voice faintly calling to him, to
which he made reply to assure him of his
safety. Looking out toward the ocean
there was no sail or boat to be seen, probably
owing to the people’s fear of meeting
the shark. A checkered bank of white
and dark clouds was massed on the sky
above the horizon, while the waves chased
one another below.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Any ordinary man would have quailed
at such a scene as this; but Bunkichi, with
no sign of nervousness, put the straw
figures in the bow of the boat and proceeded
toward the place where the shark
usually made its appearance. He could
now see the master and others above the
precipice as they began attaching the rope
to a strong limb of the sturdy pine which
projected seaward. Thus all the preparations
were made for hauling him up
at the given signal, while the lad was also
preparing himself for the encounter and
reconnoitering the scene from his boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last the iron-like fin of the monster
was seen to cleave the water. Apparently
rejoiced at the sight of a man, as Bunkichi’s
figure must have been now and then
reflected on the water, the shark in quest
of prey raised its head above the water
and made for the boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come on, you villain,” muttered the
lad, who stood up in the bow with the
dummy in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The terror-stricken young men at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>top of the precipice no sooner saw the
monster than they were on the point of
pulling up the rope; but the master stayed
them, saying: “Steady, men, steady!
Wait till he gives us a signal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master anxiously watched the lad’s
action, while the crowd hardly breathed
as they stood still with hands clenched.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a splash, Bunkichi threw the figure
in the way of the <i>wanizame</i>; the
shark turned over, the white portion of
its body gleamed, and it snapped the
stuffed figure, drawing it under the water.
Up it came again, and the lad threw out
the second dummy; but the monster did
not take any notice of it, but made straight
for the lad. Above, on the top of the precipice,
the master awaited Bunkichi’s signal
with breathless interest, but no signal was
given yet. With his dagger drawn in one
hand and raising the third straw figure in
the other, Bunkichi threw it at the enemy’s
head. Whether it was that the poison
was already taking effect or that the
charm of the noted sword frightened the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>monster, it turned back on a sudden and
retreated a few yards. Before the anxious
crowd could divine the next movements
of the shark, it began to plunge
about in and out of the water on the farther
side of the boat. Then, seemingly
in agony, it swam about with almost lightning
speed, now toward the shore and now
toward the ocean, and the sea became like
a boiling whirlpool in which the little boat
seemed every moment in danger of being
overwhelmed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, who saw his plan had succeeded,
at once began to row back. At
this juncture, as fate would have it, the
monster made a sudden dash at the boat,
which was at once overturned. The signal
had hardly been given when, after a
moment of awful anxiety, the lad was in
the air, suspended by the rope. The monster
again made a mad rush, only to bruise
its head against a rock, and with weakened
strength returned toward the deep,
riding on the retreating tide.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>“The lad was in the air, suspended by the rope”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As for Bunkichi, the rope was drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>up steadily and with care, and he soon
found himself safely perched on the stout
branch of the pine.</p>

<p class='c011'>The master of the Daikokuya, when he
saw Bunkichi once again on solid ground,
never uttered a word, but took his hand
and put it on his forehead in token of his
unutterable gratitude, while tears of joy
flowed from his eyes. The others knew
not how to do otherwise on the sudden
alternation from dread to joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a while Bunkichi left the crowd
and went to the most commanding position
on the precipice and gazed down
upon the sea, and saw the shark on its
back floating to and fro, the sport of the
waves. His joy knew no bounds, and he
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thank you all; I have been saved by
your help. The shark now seems to be
dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These words he uttered with his customary
coolness, showing that he had not
been at all frightened by the terrible experience
he had passed through, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the others could hardly yet shake off the
dread they had felt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Addressed thus by the lad, the master
now recovered his speech, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; it isn’t <i>you</i> who have been saved
by <i>us</i>, but <i>we</i> who have all been saved by
<i>you</i>. The shark dies and the people live,
or the shark lives and the people must die.
I have no words to express my gratitude
to you. And now we must get back as
soon as possible and let the people know
the joyous news.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While the master thus hurried the
others to go back, Bunkichi stopped him
and said: “Sir, if we leave the shark as
it is, it may revive. It is a pity to leave
it, now that it is as good as killed. Let us
haul it up by the aid of the rope. It
seems that the boat, which was upset, has
drifted to the base of the bluff. Let some
of us get down and bail the water out of
it, and I will, with the help of you all, try
to secure the shark.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master agreed to the proposal and
called for volunteers, but in vain. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>young fellows pretended to be ill, and
others suspected the shark might yet be
alive and swallow them if they went near
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, however, the master prevailed
on a few of them to go down with the
lad to help him.</p>

BUNKICHI, with the help of a
few others, set the boat up,
and, bailing the water out,
got in and went out again
to sea. Putting a rope round the body of
the shark, which was being tossed about
by the waves, they drew it close to the foot
of the bluff. While Bunkichi by himself
rowed back home, the young men dragged
the dead monster along the coast toward
the Daikokuya. The crowd on the bank
applied themselves as one man to the task,
and got hold of the rope, and the shark
was finally landed. Amusing it was to
see that old woman pull hard along with
the rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>After this heroic deed the reputation of
Bunkichi spread through the length and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>breadth of Kumano town, and he was
nicknamed as the <i>Wanizame-Kozo</i>, or
Shark-Boy; but who started the name no
one can tell. His exploit, however, was
soon carried to the ear of <i>Odaikan</i>,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c018'><sup>[18]</sup></a> and
this great person himself came down to
the shore and made a thorough inspection
of the monster. Ten pieces of silver were
awarded by the lord of the province to
Bunkichi in recognition of his noble services
in putting a stop to the scourge of
the town. The master was proud of Bunkichi,
and the town people rejoiced at his
good fortune.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f18'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The name given to the local magistrate in olden days.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The size of the shark which the lad
killed was more than three <i>ken</i>, or some
eighteen feet in length, and its skin was so
hard that the sharpest sword could not
pierce it. The dealers in swords vied with
one another in the offers they made the
master for the skin, for they knew it
would make an excellent binding for
sword-hilts. Bunkichi asked his master
to sell it, and the transaction was soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>made, and the master handed over the
whole of the price to Bunkichi as the
fruit of his brave deed. The lad would
not even touch it. He had heard, he said,
that the fishermen in the neighborhood,
from not being able to go out as hitherto
on account of the shark, were in great
straits even for their daily food, and
therefore he wished to distribute the
money among them. The proposal was
at once accepted, and the money was
divided either among the people who had
suffered on account of the shark, or
among the bereaved families whose members
had fallen victims to its voracity.</p>

<p class='c011'>That Bunkichi was possessed of courage,
his actions had abundantly proved;
the people were now profoundly struck
by his moral virtue since they had received
his alms. The name of <i>Wanizame-Kozo</i>
soon got its suffix <i>Sama</i>, or its
equivalent in English of “Mr.,” and whenever
he appeared in the streets everybody,
whether personally known to him or not,
seemed to thank him by making him the
most courteous obeisances.</p>

<p>“Putting a rope round the body of the shark”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>In course of time, as the people in remote
country places came to hear of Bunkichi’s
exploit, they pressed in large numbers
to the shop of the Daikokuya, not so
much to buy clothing as for the purpose
of seeing the little hero’s face. From that
day the master doubled the amount of his
daily receipts, as his trade prospered. Because
of the prosperity brought to the
house by the lad, the household of the
Daikokuya accorded him special treatment,
quite different from that given
the other boys in the shop; in fact, he
was treated as if he were the son of the
family. But Bunkichi, on his part, served
his master better than the other boys were
able or willing to. In spite of his master’s
forbidding him, he was first on the scene
in the morning to sweep the street in
front of the shop and to put the shop in
order and to sell goods to customers however
early they might come. Then, having
carefully settled accounts at the close
of the day, he would devote his evenings
to the mastery of the abacus and to writing
Chinese characters. His praiseworthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>behavior impressed everybody
who saw or heard him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two or three months passed in this
way, and the lad’s fame became ever
greater, and further prosperity was
brought to the house. Then the master
took counsel of his wife:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As we haven’t any boys, Chocho being
the only child we have, sooner or later
we shall have to adopt a son. I don’t care
to have any one of whose intentions and
character I know nothing. Rather it
would please me to have Bunkichi as our
foster-son. What do you think about
this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>His wife said gladly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I agree with you, my husband; he
would be just the one to whom to leave
the conduct of the business, and if we
could make him our adopted son, what a
pleasure it would be! You had better do
it quickly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master pondered awhile and then
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, you see, he hopes to become the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>leading merchant in Japan, and thereby
to raise the name of his ancestors; therefore
he would not like to be adopted into
another family. This would be the first
hitch in the arrangement, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, my dear; our intention, of course,
is to give him the whole of this our property—and
that certainly should be sufficient
inducement to any one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I think not,” said the other, as he
put his head on one side in contemplation;
“he is not the boy who will prize such a
small property as ours. I don’t care to
run the risk of humbling myself by speaking
to him rashly. What I want is to ascertain
his intention at some opportune
moment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sadakichi, who had been playing in
company with the little girl on the veranda
outside the <i>shoji</i>, first heard this conversation,
and one day told Bunkichi about
it. The latter said to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My intention has been to win fame
and thereby to raise our ancestors’ name,
so it would never do for me to be adopted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>into another family. Trouble will come
if I stay here any longer, and I shall be
put in such a strait that I shall feel obliged
to fall in with this proposal.” So he
thought he would do best to leave the
house quickly and try his hand independently
at some trade.</p>

<p class='c011'>One evening he sought his master and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, it is rather an abrupt request to
make of you, but I have conceived a plan
by which I can earn money; so please let
me trade by myself. As capital to start
with, it will be sufficient for me to employ
those silver coins which I received for
reward and which you have kept for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master, without knowing the lad’s
secret intention, said: “If you wish to
trade on your own account, I will lend
you capital or give you any help you want;
but what is the plan you have in mind?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s simply this, sir. Since the disappearance
of the <i>wanizame</i> the people
nowadays get an abundant catch of fish,
and in consequence I hear there is a scarcity
of fishing-tackle, nets, and their belongings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>So I wish to go up to Osaka
and get a supply.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master made one clap with his
hands in token of his approval, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well thought of, my lad! If you get
a supply from Osaka now, you are sure to
reap a good profit. Besides, all the fishermen
round about here received your alms
and regard you as one of the gods. If
they hear of your selling fishing-tackle,
they will gladly come to purchase of you.
But you cannot transact the business by
yourself alone, so I will send some one to
assist you, and also I will lend you as
much capital as you wish. Therefore, go
and make whatever investment you think
necessary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi did not wish to receive this
favor, as he intended trading without the
help of any one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, let me trade with my own capital
alone without any other help in this instance,”
he replied. “Only, when the
cargo comes, will you please give it storeroom
for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the master knew Bunkichi would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>be induced to accept others’ advice when
he had definitely made up his mind, he
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, then; you may try to
manage for yourself. No other boy of
your age could transact the business, but
probably you may succeed.” Thus saying,
he went himself and brought a packet
of money.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is the money I have been keeping
for you.” And then he produced another
packet which contained fifty pieces
of silver, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is only a trifling recognition of
your services in the shop, by which we
have enjoyed much prosperity; I hope you
will accept it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi again and again refused to
accept this additional gift, but in vain, for
the master almost forced him to receive
it, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you come back from Osaka,
you will stay again with us, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi hesitated and stammered out:
“Yes, sir; I might trouble you again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>though I intend to continue in some trade
of my own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course you may go in for whatever
trade you like, and if you can conveniently
carry on your trade while you stay
at my house, please make yourself at home
in it, and do not think that you need help
in my shop on that account.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Bunkichi had no other home, he accepted
this kind offer for his future protection
after his return, and the next day,
when he had prepared himself for the
journey, he left the Daikokuya for Osaka.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though he was a boy in appearance,
his mind was equal to that of a full-grown
man. At the time of his leave-taking, the
master was insisting on getting him a
through <i>kago</i>, or Japanese palanquin, to
Osaka, which he had refused as unnecessary.
In his courageous onward march
he came to a lonely part of the road; he
was, however, well used to traveling,
owing to those early days of wandering
when he sold the dragon-flies for the support
of his family, and by the experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of his lonely journey to Kumano. But in
this present journey, as he carried with
him a great sum of money in his pocket,
he felt somewhat encumbered and could
not walk as lightly as he wished.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the afternoon of the day when he
came to the mountainous region he was
well-nigh tired out, and he hired a <i>kago</i> to
carry him. The coolies no sooner put him
into the palanquin than they started off at
almost a running pace, and after a short
time they turned off from the highway
into a bypath. The lad called out, in suspicion:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aren’t you taking a rather strange
road?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Both coolies answered in one voice:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a short cut, lad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As they went on they got more and
more into the wilds of the mountains, and
Bunkichi thought to himself that they
might belong to that class of rascals who
prey on the traveler’s pockets. Nevertheless
it was too late to do anything against
them, so he kept himself in perfect peace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>by determining not to show that he suspected
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the coolies were come to a trackless
thicket, they put the <i>kago</i> down, and,
thinking to pull out the boy, looked in and
found him fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>They stared at one another in astonishment
and said: “Why, he is sleeping!
The fellow takes life easy, eh? Come, my
boy, get up! get up!” and one of them
poked him on the shoulder, and the other,
taking hold of his foot, pulled him out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi rubbed his eyes and yawned
twice or thrice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Mr. Coolie,—I mean you two,—what’s
the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The coolies said somewhat fiercely:
“Look here; you’ve got some money with
you, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He answered in perfect coolness, as if
nothing had happened, “Yes, I have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They thought more and more the lad
was a pretty easy simpleton to deal with,
and said: “We knew you had some fifty
or sixty <i>rio</i>, and that is why we brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>you here. Come, now, hand out all you’ve
got, for if you refuse you’ll suffer for it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lad burst out into laughter, saying:
“If you want the money you shall have
it”; and he took out the wrapped package
of money and threw it down in front of
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coolies, seeing the perfect composure
of the lad, wondered who this boy
could be, and they began to grow nervous,
and one of them said in a whisper to the
other: “May he not be a fox?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We don’t know but what this money
may turn into tree-leaves,” was the answer,
and both looked into the boy’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy said, as he smiled: “You cowardly
thieves, are you afraid?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stepped out a pace before them,
while they stepped back a little and said,
“We are not afraid,” visibly suppressing
their fear.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lad peered into their faces. “If
you aren’t afraid, why do you tremble
so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’re cold; that is why.”</p>

<div id='i083'  class='figcenter id001'>

<img src='images/i083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“As though they were stricken by thunder at the boy’s words, down they tumbled on the ground”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“You cowards! Take the money and
be gone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The coolies looked at each other, and
wouldn’t take the money up into their
hands, while the lad stood firmly grasping
the hilt of the dagger of Kiku-ichi-monji
within his pocket, ready to fight it
out in case they might treat him roughly.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were thoroughly outwitted by the
audacity of the lad, and said: “Where
have you come from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kumano is my home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One of them turned pale. “Why, maybe
he is the Shark-Boy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am that very boy,” retorted the
lad.</p>

<p class='c011'>No sooner did the coolies hear this than
they cried with one voice: “Let us up and
be gone!” As they were about to turn
on their heels, Bunkichi said, as he drew
his dagger:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you run off I will cut you in two.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As though they were stricken by thunder
at the boy’s words, down they tumbled
on the ground, and could not rise in spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of themselves. “Only spare our lives, if
you please!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As they begged for mercy, the lad
coldly smiled, saying: “What is it you
fear?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please spare us! We cannot bear the
thought that you will finish us off as you
did the <i>wanizame</i>,” they gasped in a
trembling voice. These coolies had heard
of his brave deed in killing the shark, and
they thought that he had killed it by a feat
of swordsmanship, and that he was a warrior
general like him of Ushiwaka-maru<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c018'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
of old. He at once perceived what was
the cause of their fear, and said:</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f19'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A boy hero who learned fencing from a mountain elf
in the wilderness of Atago.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Are you weaker than the <i>wani</i>?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; we sha’n’t be beaten by the
<i>wani</i>,”—though they still trembled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi resheathed his short sword as
he said: “Then take me to where we
agreed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a prompt “Yes, sir,” they rose up,
while the lad got into the palanquin. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>took up the money and nervously brought
it to the lad, who said as he glanced at it:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Put it on the top of the <i>kago</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’re afraid it may drop down unnoticed,”
was their answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s too heavy for me to carry; tie
it somewhere where it will be safe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the coolies tightly tied the package
to the pole by which the <i>kago</i> was carried.
He did not take the money with him
again, for fear that they might harm him
in case their avaricious temper got the upper
hand and they should make off with it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coolies, however, had no courage
left to renew their attempt; but they went
on most solemnly and steadily, as though
they were carrying the <i>tengu</i>.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c018'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Bunkichi,
finding the situation rather too quiet and
tame, addressed them: “Do you often
play the part of villains?”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f20'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A mountain elf.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir. It was the first time, sir.
We were tempted to the wickedness when
we saw you were carrying a lot of money;
we knew it by your manner of walking.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“I don’t believe you. I suspect you
have committed villainous acts a good
many times, but henceforth there must be
an end of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir; we have had a lesson and
sha’n’t try that game again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lad laughed and said: “That is interesting!”
This was a peculiar exclamation
he used often to make.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Bunkichi came to a certain
station where he got out of the <i>kago</i>. He

HAVING stayed that night at
an inn, Bunkichi hastened on
his way along the Hama-Kaido,
or the “shore road.”
When he came to a lonely spot in the road,
he saw a man in the distance, scantily clad,
apparently making preparations for hanging
himself. On ran Bunkichi and caught
hold of the man, asking him at the same
time why he had come to such a pass as to
attempt suicide.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am a certain Kichidayu, a native of
Sakai in Izumi Province, and a sailor,”
answered the man, while tears stood in his
eyes as he spoke. “I was in charge of a
ship of one thousand <i>koku</i>,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c018'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and on my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>voyage to Yedo with a cargo of <i>sake</i><a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c018'><sup>[22]</sup></a> my
boat was wrecked off this coast and the
crew of eighteen, all told, as well as the
whole of the cargo, were lost. Fortunately
I was washed up on the coast while
I was holding fast to a piece of board, but
having been terribly knocked about, I can
hardly drag myself along. Besides, the
loss of the ship, the cargo as well as the
crew, overpowers me with such a sense of
disgrace and wretchedness that I thought
I would rather die than go back to my
native town.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f21'>

<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A kind of Japanese liquor.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, while he was listening to the
sad account of the wreck, surveyed the
man from head to foot, and perceived
many severe bruises, which—with his
honest manner of speaking—seemed to
prove the truth of his words.</p>

<div id='i091'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i091.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Giving him a helping hand, Bunkichi led the man along to the next village”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“I quite sympathize with you in your
misfortune,” said he, “but, my man, your
dying will not bring back the ship which
was wrecked nor the men who were lost;
so I think it would be better for you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>keep yourself alive and atone for your loss
by succeeding with your next venture.
But without money you can’t even go to
a doctor. So allow me—”</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking out five pieces of silver and putting
them in the hand of the sailor, he continued,
kindly and soothingly, “With
these get a doctor at once, my man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain, as he looked into Bunkichi’s
face with an expression almost of
worship, said: “You are the kindest man
I ever came across, in spite of your apparent
youthfulness. As long as I live I shall
not forget you, and some day, perhaps,
I may have an opportunity to repay you
for your goodness to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While he said this, tears rushed from
his eyes—for he was overcome by a sense
of gratitude and joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, having taken off his <i>haori</i>,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c018'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
said to the man: “Put this on, though it
is not sufficient to protect you, and come
on with me to my next stopping-place.”
Though the seaman was reluctant to accept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>so generous an offer, Bunkichi urged
him, and, giving him a helping hand, led
the man along to the next village, where
they found an inn, into which they went.
There a suit of clothes was purchased for
the sailor, and the lad recounted the story
of the wreck to the old woman, the keeper
of the inn, and asked her to send for a
doctor, who on arrival did whatever he
could for the poor man.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f23'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A Japanese upper garment.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, who thought it likely he
might be of more service to the sailor,
said, in answer to his question: “I have
no house of my own, but you will find me
if you ask for one Bunkichi at the Daikokuya,
a cloth establishment at Kumano.
You, being a sailor, are sure to find any
amount of work if you go there; so please
look me up. I am in a hurry; I cannot
stop here longer. On my way back from
Osaka I shall call upon you. If you are
well before then, you had better go to Kumano
and wait for me there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus kindly holding out hopes of helping
him in the future, he gave the old woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>a sum of money for the nursing of
the sailor, and hurried on his way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Going on from one hotel to another,
and resolving to lose no time, Bunkichi at
last arrived in the city of Osaka. As he
had received a letter of introduction from
his master to a certain wholesale merchant
of the city, with whom the Daikokuya
had dealings, he went to this merchant
and asked for the articles he had been
commissioned to buy. The head of the
house, acquainted with the <i>wanizame</i> affair
by the letter, did everything in his
power to assist Bunkichi, and the transaction
went off smoothly and quickly. After
he had sent off the fishing-tackle to
Kumano on board a ship, he spent a few
days in sight-seeing as well as in observing
the ways in which big merchants carried
on their trade. Having thus spent
four or five days here, Bunkichi once more
took the same road home, and on the way
inquired at the inn after the captain whom
he had left there. To his great joy, the
sailor was well on the way to recovery;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>so he gave the man some more money for
his further needs, and hastened on to
Kumano-Ura, having promised to meet
him again there.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the day following that on which he
had taken leave of the sailor, he came to
the hilly roads near Kumano. This part
of the country was noted then, as it is to-day,
for the production of oranges. All
over the hills he saw orange-trees in abundance,
and there, strange enough, he
heard a great noise of screaming and
chattering. He hastened his steps in the
direction of the noise. Lo, and behold!
Hundreds of monkeys, uncountable, had
drawn a circle around three men, whom
they were pelting with a shower of stones.
These wretched men, as they were apparently
unable to withstand the stone missiles
of the monkeys, had pulled their over-coats,
or <i>haori</i>, over their heads and were
crouching under an orange-bush, apparently
in despair, for they were doing nothing
but crying for help.</p>

<div id='i097'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i097.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Hundreds of monkeys had drawn a circle around three men whom they were pelting with a shower of stones”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As the animals apparently thought it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>great fun, they kept on showering stones
as quickly as they could pick them up, and
it seemed probable that the three men
would have fallen victims to the monkeys
but for Bunkichi. When he saw how
things were going, quick as thought he
picked up a lot of pebbles from the wayside
and filled both his spacious sleeves
and his front pocket as well. Thus well
armed, on he rushed to the monkey army
and pulled out of his pocket the pebbles,
one after another, throwing them at the
frisky creatures. The monkeys, as they
screamed and chattered, at once confronted
the lad, and, perceiving him pull
out stones from his breast, they tried to do
the same. But of course they had no
pockets with stones in them, while Bunkichi
threw his missiles thick and fast. The
beasts in their rage began to pull off the
hair from their breasts and throw it from
them, while their monkey-chatter grew
louder and louder as their pain increased.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, who could not suppress his
laughter, contrived, as it were, to discharge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the missiles from his breast while
actually bringing out the stones from his
sleeves. As the monkeys drew closer to
him, still pulling off their hair, the three
men were now given time to breathe.
They at once came out from their hiding-place,
and, scolding the monkeys, began
to pick up stones to help in their turn their
deliverer in his stand against them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The youth cried out, as he quickly perceived
their action: “No! No! Don’t
<i>pick up</i> stones! If any of you have the
instruments for striking fire, set fire as
quickly as you can to the dry grass.” The
men did as they were told, and as the wind
fanned the fire the smoke and flames soon
spread over the ground. The army of
monkeys, thinking the day was lost, set
up a great chatter and, jumping from tree
to tree, disappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>The men now recovered from their
fright, and, having put out the fire,
thanked Bunkichi and said: “We are most
grateful to you, sir. If you had not come
we should almost to a certainty have been
stoned to death by the monkeys.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“It was a narrow escape, wasn’t it?”
remarked Bunkichi, “but I am curious to
know—did you not throw stones at them
first?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” replied the men, with animated
expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi could not help smiling as he
thought of how they had acted, and said:
“You know monkeys are foolish animals
and try to imitate whatever others do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You seem to know everything,” said
the men, who were much struck by his
wisdom. “But where have you come
from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I live at Kumano,” was the reply,
“but was brought up at Kada-no-Ura; so
I know about monkeys, as we have plenty
of them there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the leading one of the three, making
a polite bow, urged Bunkichi, saying:
“I am the owner of this orange farm, and
my home is not far from here. Please
come to my house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On the way thither he asked the boy his
name and where his home was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am one Bunkichi in the establishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>called the Daikokuya, at Kumano,”
was his frank answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The host, having well observed the lad’s
face, said: “Ah, that’s why I thought I
had seen you somewhere. Then you are
that widely famed Mr. Wanizame-Kozo,
the Shark-Boy! The people in this neighborhood
owe you a great debt of gratitude,
because all the fruits produced here
in this part, oranges among other things,
when they are sent either to Tokio or to
Osaka, must first be sent to Kumano-Ura
to be shipped to those cities. But ever
since the appearance of that monster in
the harbor, all the shipping trade had come
entirely to a standstill, and we had to send
our fruits to other ports by a roundabout
way, which was a great nuisance to us;
whereas, owing to your wisdom and courage,
we can now send our cargo to Kumano
as we did before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After a pleasant visit of an hour or two,
Bunkichi was about to start. The host
stopped him for a minute and brought out
a little packet of money, and, placing it before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>him, said: “This trifle is only a token
of my gratitude to you. Please take it.”
Looking at it from the outside, it certainly
seemed no trifle; but the lad firmly but politely
declined to accept it, saying: “You
have no need to thank me.” And he would
not take it, in spite of the host’s earnest
entreaty. At last he said: “I don’t wish
to receive any recompense from you; however,
I have one favor to ask if you will
grant it me. I am thinking of trading
on my own account before long in various
articles, and if I come here some day to
buy oranges, will you deal with me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You make a very modest request,” answered
the host with ready assent. “I
will supply you with a cargo as cheaply as
possible at any moment you send me the
order, and as to the payment, I shall be in
no hurry for it; you may pay me whenever
you like. I can supply you with
thirty thousand boxes of oranges from
my own farm; and there are many more
farmers in the neighborhood who will be
glad to supply you if I let them know that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>you are the Wanizame-Kozo. At least I
can assure you I will fill your order, however
large it may be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With many thanks, Bunkichi took his
leave and was back in the Daikokuya that
evening.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
THE cargo of fishing-tackle
which had been sent from
Osaka had already arrived
at Kumano and was awaiting
his return, so Bunkichi took his goods to
the fishing villages round about Kumano
for sale. The people vied with one another
in buying them, on account of their
being sold by Mr. Shark-Boy. Owing to
the price of tackle being then much higher
than at other times, as a result of the
scarcity of the supply, he made such a
good sale that the profit doubled the cost
of his outlay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking care not to waste the money
thus obtained, he next opened a trade in
oranges, buying them at a cheap rate from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the owner of the orange farm and retailing
them at Kumano when the market
value was high. By this means he made
another good profit; still he stayed on in
the Daikokuya as his temporary home,
and applied himself to business. Thus by
the end of the next year he had saved several
times the amount of his original capital.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Kichidayu, the sailor to
whom he had given kind help, came to him
after he had completely recovered. Bunkichi
asked the master of the Daikokuya
to employ him. He consented, and committed
to him, in the capacity of captain,
the management of a big ship.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now Kichidayu’s devotion to Bunkichi
was so great that he was ready to sacrifice
his own life for his sake if occasion
should arise. “I admire your determination
immensely, and as I owe my life to
you, you may count on me for any assistance
in my power,” said the sailor to the
boy one day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi rejoiced on hearing this and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>said, laughingly: “When the time comes
in which I shall make my fortune, such
property as the Daikokuya possesses I will
create in ten days.”</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c011'>Four years had passed, during which time
Bunkichi had done well in his business,
trading in various articles, and a portion
of his profit he now and then distributed
among the poor people in the district. He
was now eighteen years of age. It was the
autumn of the year, and from the beginning
of the month of October a westerly
wind had been blowing many days. As a
consequence, the shipping trade at Kumano-Ura
was entirely stopped. Yet a cargo
of oranges bound from Kii Province for
Yedo<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c018'><sup>[24]</sup></a> was accumulating at Kumano-Ura
and beginning to rot away on account of
the warm climate of the province. From
Yedo had been received vain messages,
by the <i>hikiaku</i>, or running postmen, urging
them to send up the oranges, the necessary
fruit for the <i>Fuigo Matsuri</i>, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>bellows festival, which was then at hand.
Yet the sea became rougher every day as
the wind grew stronger, while the frowning
autumn sky hung overhead. The people
could not possibly put out any ship
nor do anything but stare and grumble
at the rough sea and the lowering clouds.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f24'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r24'>24</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The old name of the great Japanese city now called Tokio.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Every day Bunkichi went down to the
seashore also, and looked at the dark sky
as every one else did, yet he alone had a
certain expression of suppressed joy in
his face. The others said, “We hope this
stormy weather will come to an end soon,”
while he answered, “I hope it will do nothing
of the kind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were surprised at this and said,
“Why, what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who can tell?” he answered, laughing.
While he was thus engaged in casual
talk, Kichidayu, the sailor, came to
look at the condition of the sea. On seeing
him the lad beckoned him aside by a
tree and said: “Kichidayu San, when do
you suppose this wind will cease?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish it would stop soon,” he answered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“but it doesn’t look like it, I
fear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I shall be greatly disappointed if
it stops within two or three days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, there’s not much chance of its
doing so,” was the sailor’s answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s good,” the boy replied. “Before
it stops what do you say to having
a sail in a boat from here to Yedo? It
would be fine, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Kichidayu stared at Bunkichi in astonishment
and said: “Don’t joke, please. If
we were to put out a boat in this rough
sea, it would capsize in no time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s just where the interest lies.
Wouldn’t Kichidayu San like to try it for
once?” said the lad, while the other replied,
laughing, “Don’t carry your joking
too far!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi became serious. “Kichidayu
San, I’m not joking. If it was an east
or a north wind it would be difficult,
of course, but being a west wind, it’s a
fair wind toward Yedo, however strong
it may be, and so there is no reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>why we should not be able to get to
Yedo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Kichidayu, who thought that Bunkichi
was saying rather a strange thing, answered:
“If we should have good luck,
I don’t say that it’s impossible; however,
I do say it could only be a question of good
luck.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s just where the interest lies,”
said the lad again. “One can do anything
that others can do. But it’s a fine thing
for a man to go to a place when others
can’t go. Kichidayu San, the time has
now come to make that fortune of money
of which I told you once, because in Yedo
the price of oranges, which are one of the
necessaries of the bellows festival, has
gone up ten times higher than at other
times, on account of the scarcity of the
fruit. Here, in this port, where the
oranges have accumulated because they
can find no customers, the price has gone
down ten times lower than the rate at
which they usually sell. So, if we can
buy at a price ten times lower than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>usual rate, and sell at a price ten times
higher than the usual rate, naturally a
hundred <i>rio</i> will make ten thousand <i>rio</i>.
There isn’t likely to come such a good
chance twice in a lifetime. As to the ship,
I will ask the master of the Daikokuya to
let me have a big one, and if he does, will
you captain it for me? I intend to take
out in it a large cargo of oranges to Yedo
while this bad weather prevails.” The
lad thus for the first time revealed his ambitious
scheme.</p>

<p class='c011'>Kichidayu folded both his arms on his
breast in contemplation. Then, as he
lifted his head, he said: “I will make the
attempt—yes, even to Yedo, for your
sake; I don’t grudge even my life. What
if my ship gets wrecked? I don’t care.
But are you thinking of coming on
board?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course; if I don’t go, the business
can’t be effected,” said Bunkichi. “Trading
is the same as a battle. In one of the
battles of old the warrior Yoshisune set
us an example by attacking the army of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the Hei clan in the province of Shikoku
by sending out the war vessels from Daimotsuga-Ura
on a stormy night. If we
lose courage in such weather as this, we
cannot possibly accomplish any great
scheme. We shall enter upon it resolutely.
Should we die, let us die together. If I
gain my object, I will handsomely reward
you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall have to offer sailors ten
times their usual pay,” continued Bunkichi;
“you may then, perhaps, find fellows
who will be willing to come. Will
you be responsible for finding them?”
So saying, he gave the captain money for
the purpose, and, having intrusted the
matter to him, at once went home to the
Daikokuya and saw the master.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Danna,” said he, “among your ships
the oldest is that <i>Tenjin-maru</i><a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c018'><sup>[25]</sup></a> of one
thousand <i>koku</i> burthen, is it not?”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f25'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r25'>25</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A Japanese junk.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The master, who was somewhat startled
by the abruptness of the question,
said: “Yes, she is getting to be an old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>vessel now, and I am thinking of breaking
her up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you sell her to me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>To which the master answered: “If
you want her, I don’t mind making you a
present of her; but what use will you put
her to?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m thinking of taking a cargo of
oranges to Yedo,” was the lad’s reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the bad weather is over, I suppose?”
said the master.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; while this stormy weather is prevailing,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>The master was startled, but gazing on
the boy for a moment, merely remarked:
“What an extraordinary idea!”</p>

<p class='c011'>After a little hesitation, Bunkichi drew
nearer to the master. “Pray, master, sell
her to me,” said he; “I am again going
out on a trading battle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the master understood his real
intention and said: “Well, if you are so
minded, you may not be afraid of this
storm; but the <i>Tenjin-maru</i> is in any case
a dangerous ship for this weather; so I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>will lend you one which is more seaworthy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, thank you, sir; I have no wish
to borrow,” replied the lad. “This undertaking
is a matter of fate. If I am
wrecked on the way out I cannot give you
your ship back again; so I shall not borrow
things of others, for I wish to do
everything on my own capital.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master knew the boy’s nature and
made no further objection, but said:
“Very well, I will sell her to you. You
will surely succeed. Come back again
laden with treasure!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Chocho, the master’s daughter, who
was now sixteen years of age, overheard
the conversation between the two and was
much surprised, and expressed her anxiety
as well as her sorrow in her face, and
said: “Does Bunkichi go to Yedo in this
storm?” The mother, too, longed to stop
him, but could not well interfere, because
her husband had already yielded his sanction
to the boy’s scheme. She only said,
loud enough to be heard by both, as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>answered her daughter: “Yes, Cho, it is
most dangerous to go out to sea in this
great wind and storm!” To which the
girl responded: “Yes, mother!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, having paid the price of the
<i>Tenjin-maru</i> to his master, went to the
wholesale stores which were best known
to him and bought up their oranges. The
merchants, as they were sore oppressed
by the rotting of the fruit, were in the
state of “panting blue breath,” as they
say. Bunkichi, in a somewhat off-hand
manner, said to one of them: “Do the
oranges rot every day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, every day we are much troubled
about it; they rot away continually. Already
half of the stock we have is spoiled;
if it goes on at this rate, within another
ten days our whole stock will be lost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whereupon the lad said: “Are you
really prepared to sell them at whatever
price you can get for them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, gladly; for how much better
would it be to sell even at a loss than to
pay for throwing the rotten stuff away!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>To which Bunkichi answered: “If that
is the case, I will buy from you at sixteen
<i>mon</i> per box as much stock as you have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The merchant was taken aback at the
reply, and said: “Isn’t that <i>too</i> cheap?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if they rot away, you will get
nothing. I am not over-keen to buy,” said
the lad, coldly; “so if you don’t wish to
sell, we need not have any further talk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just wait a minute,” and the merchant
stayed the lad as he was about to leave.
“I will sell at sixteen <i>mon</i> a box if you
will buy up my whole stock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the whole lot,” said Bunkichi.
“I will buy as many thousand boxes as I
can put into a large ship.” Thus he
bought up the whole stock of that store
and then went on to another, buying up
the whole stock of each at a very low price.
Then he sent a man to the orange farm
and collected some more. Having procured
a large stock, he put it all on board
the <i>Tenjin-maru</i> so that, albeit the ship
was one of a thousand <i>koku</i> burthen, its
keel sank deep into the water.</p>

AS Captain Kichidayu sought
for sailors by holding out to
them promise of wages ten
times more than they could
get at other times, he soon picked up six
sturdy fellows who did not set much value
on their lives. Thereupon he reported
his success to Bunkichi, who was rejoiced
over it, and said: “Then all things are
ready now; we shall settle to start in the
morning, and I will send to the ship ten
pieces of long square timbers. You will
place them crosswise on the ship and attach
to their ends heavy stones so that
she will not upset easily,” he continued,
with his usual audacity and resourcefulness.
“For I have heard that ships which
sail about those far-off islands, Hachijo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and Oshima, and the like, are fitted out in
this way and sail in safety even in heavy
storms. That is why in Yedo they call
those island-ships ‘sea-sparrows’: the
weight being on both sides of the ship,
they never upset.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Kichidayu was much struck by his keen
observation, and said: “Truly, it didn’t
occur to my mind that those ships are
fitted out as you say, but now I recollect
having seen them off the coast of Izu
Province. As they are thus constructed
they never capsize, however much they
are washed over by waves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Kichidayu San,” Bunkichi said,
“this ship is called the <i>Tenjin-maru</i>, but
our going out to sea this time may mean
going to her destruction, so let us change
her name into <i>Iurei-maru</i>, or ghost-ship,
and let us imagine ourselves to be dead
men by putting on white clothes. Thus
nothing that may occur can scare the
crew; for, being ‘dead’ men, they can
have no fear of death.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>The captain agreed with him, saying:
“That’s a splendid idea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain returned to his abode in
high spirits and told to the six seamen
what the lad had said, and they all readily
agreed to the plan, and were so stirred by
the lad’s courage that they were ready to
face any dangers or fears that might come
to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi at once ordered a man to
paint on the sail of the ship: “<i>Iurei-maru</i>”
in large Chinese characters, and
at the cloth establishment of the Daikokuya,
he ordered eight suits of white
clothes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bunkichi,” inquired the astonished
master, “what is the use of those eight
suits of white?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi laughed as he answered:
“We may all be dead men before long, if
we go out to sea in this storm. The
chances of surviving are few, so we are
already dead in heart. I have named my
ship <i>Iurei-maru</i>. We are going to dress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>in white with the <i>zudabukuro</i><a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c018'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and we
shall stick triangular-shaped papers on
our foreheads, as they do for the dead.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f26'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r26'>26</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The purse tied round the neck of the dead at a burial
service in Japan.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“What horrible things you do!” exclaimed
the wife, while the daughter, Chocho,
with sudden inspiration, said: “I
will sew your white suit for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am most grateful,” replied the lad,
“but I have already ordered others to do
it for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please let me do it,” said the girl.
“It may be the last—” and at this Bunkichi
consented with thanks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The master, who seemed to have prepared
beforehand, ordered <i>sake</i> and a set
of little dishes of eatables to be brought
forth, and then remarked: “As you have
settled to start to-morrow I intend to
offer you a congratulatory feast in advance,
hoping that you may arrive at
Yedo and have good luck and make a
great profit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At last the morrow came, and early in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the morning Bunkichi bade farewell to the
men of the Daikokuya and put on his
white suit, which was made by the daughter
of the house, and went out to the seashore.
The master, as well as his wife,
with their daughter, Chocho, and all the
employees in the shop, followed him in
order to see him off. Having heard of his
departure, some of the townspeople with
whom he was acquainted, and those poor
people who had received his alms, flocked
together from the four corners of the
town to bid him good-by.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having bade farewell to the people,
Bunkichi entered a small boat and soon
got on board of the <i>Iurei-maru</i>. Those
who came to see him off, as they stood
around the shore, raised their voices, calling
out for Bunkichi, lamenting his departure.
Bunkichi gave a signal for the
anchor to be weighed and the sail to be
hoisted; then the ship soon stood out to
sea. Both the men on the shore and those
on board the ship waved their hands till
their forms had become indiscernible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>while the ship, driven by the strong west
wind, soon became lost to sight among
the big waves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though the <i>Iurei-maru</i> had her sail up
only seven tenths of its whole length, she
sailed on eastward with the speed of an
arrow, owing to the strong wind. In a
very short time she passed the Sea of Kumano,
and then soon was in the Sea of Isè.
As she came to the noted Yenshiu-nada
on the evening of that day, the wind grew
stronger and the rain came down in torrents.
As the huge waves, mountain-high,
came rushing from the far ocean
and the ship was tossed like a tree-leaf,
the crew felt as if they were flung down
into the abyss of darkness when she got
into the trough of the waves. Those six
robust men, who had hitherto worked
with steady and fearless courage, suddenly
gave in before this state of the sea
and lost all heart for labor. Nevertheless
Captain Kichidayu, as steady as ever, ran
about here and there, stirring the crew up
to their work.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Among the eight men all told, the one
most unaffected by the dreadful state of
the sea was Bunkichi, the <i>Wanizame-Kozo</i>,
and he, with the captain, lent a
helping hand to the tired crew, calling out
occasionally: “Hurrah! This is fine!
We shall get to Yedo within the next day.
Work hard, all of you, and you sha’n’t
want for pay!” And then he doled out
money to the crew, who were encouraged
by this and braced themselves up and labored
their best.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile night fell and the storm continued.
Though nothing was visible to
the eyes, the awful sound of the waves,
and the wind, which shook masts and rigging,
deafened the ears; and the heaven
and the earth seemed to be swallowed up
by the waters.</p>

<p class='c011'>By degrees the crew’s courage began
again to fail and one of them muttered:
“This is just the sort of night for some
big monster like a <i>wanizame</i> to appear!”
To which another said: “Yes; I feel a bit
nervous, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Come, men; a little more perseverance!”
shouted out Bunkichi. So saying,
he again gave them an extra wage
and continued: “You fear the <i>wanizame</i>,
do you? I rather think the <i>wanizame</i> will
be afraid of me because I’m the <i>Wanizame-Kozo</i>.
Take heart, all of you!
Don’t be afraid!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The men were cheered up and said:
“Truly enough, you once killed the <i>wanizame</i>.
We needn’t be afraid! Now, all
right, sir; we’re rid of our fears!”</p>

<p class='c011'>However, their courage was of but
short duration; when they gazed at the
dark, angry sea they again lost heart,
saying: “But, sir, what shall we do if the
<i>umi-bozu</i><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c018'><sup>[27]</sup></a> comes up—if it is true, as the
people say, the monster lives in this
ocean?”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f27'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r27'>27</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An imaginary giant of the sea.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, as he gave them a scornful
smile, stood up with his dagger in his hand
and said: “I’ll sweep him down with this
sword if any such creature makes his appearance.”</p>

<div id='i125'  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
<img src='images/i125.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“He drew his sword and ran toward the monster”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Just then the man on watch suddenly
shrieked: “Ah! the sea-giant has come!”
And he ran back toward the stern while
the others were frightened out of their
wits and ran down into the cabin where
they drew their heads back between their
shoulders and held their breath in fear.
Bunkichi looked toward the bow. Sure
enough, a big undefined dark form rose
at the front of the ship, about ten feet in
height. He drew his sword and ran toward
the monster. As he swept the giant
down with his sharp weapon, he laughingly
returned toward Kichidayu, who
stood by the mast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was that?” Kichidayu asked
Bunkichi, who answered, still smiling:
“It <i>did</i> look like a round-headed giant,
but really it was only a column of mist
which came floating in our way. That’s
what they call the ‘sea-giant,’ I suppose,
and in their fright they fancied it was
coming on board to seize them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Kichidayu, who was much surprised at
Bunkichi’s courage, said: “Indeed! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>understand now how you could kill the
<i>wanizame</i>, by the courage you have just
shown, and which I cannot but admire.
To speak the truth, I didn’t feel very
bold myself when I saw that big dark
form, but I screwed my courage up so as
not to be laughed at by you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the crew had not yet come out of
their cabin, Kichidayu called out: “Now,
men, come up; your master has killed the
giant. Come quick, quick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The crew trooped out at this, and said:
“Truly we heard a shriek a little while
ago!” At which Kichidayu muttered,
“Fools!”</p>

<p class='c011'>During the night, however, they got
over the Sea of Yenshiu in this manner,
and in the very early morning of the third
day they were entering the Bay of Yedo.
Gradually the sea was becoming much
smoother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are safe, master. We can, too, be
quite at ease in our hearts!” said one of
the men. “Ah! I see the headland of
Haneda there. Beyond that there’s the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Bay of Shinagawa. If we go forward at
this rate we shall be at Yedo by dawn:
I feel safe now. But I felt that I would
be eaten alive when I saw the <i>umi-bozu</i>
at the Yenshiu-nada Sea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Bunkichi said, as he laughed:
“You don’t know what you are saying.
We have been all along dead men in white
suits, and for dead men to have been alive
is an absurdity!” Then all, for the first
time, burst out into merry, hearty laughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Kichidayu turned to Bunkichi,
saying: “Master, what a voyage! In a
couple of days and nights we sailed the
distance which takes about ten days at
other times. That we have come here
safely through this storm is due to your
contrivance of laying the timbers crosswise
on the boat; but for that we should
certainly have capsized.” Then he turned
to the sailors and added: “What say you,
my men? Is there any one who could
beat him in wit or in courage?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, there’s not another like him,” all
replied in one voice. “He killed the <i>wanizame</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>as well as the <i>umi-bozu</i>, and so long
as we are with him there is nothing on
earth to be dreaded. Please, sir, employ
us under you for years to come. We shall
never again play cowards as we did, sir!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi replied: “I fear you would
never face the <i>umi-bozu</i>.” To which they
could say nothing, but scratched their
heads in silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though the wind was still high, after
the storm through which they had fought
their way out, the inland seas seemed to
them “as smooth as matting,” as the saying
is, and soon after dawn all hands on
board the <i>Iurei-maru</i> arrived safely at
Yedo.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that time in Yedo the orange merchants,
in spite of the stress of weather,
had been eagerly awaiting orange-ships
from Kishu Province every day, on account
of the nearness of the bellows festival.
And this was the only ship that did
not disappoint their expectations. When
the ship’s arrival was known, the joy of
the merchants was beyond description,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and soon this popular song immortalized
the happy welcome of the orange-ship:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
WHEN all the wholesale dealers
in oranges in the vast city of
Yedo heard that an orange-ship
had at last arrived from
Kishu, they vied with one another in coming
to Bunkichi’s ship and buying up his
oranges. The inevitable result of the rise
in the price of oranges was to make him
a gainer of more than fifty thousand <i>rio</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunkichi, after this, carefully reasoned
out that on account of the recent continuance
of the west wind no ship could possibly
have sailed from Yedo to Osaka, so
that there must be a scarcity of salted
salmon in that city, while there was now
an abundant and specially cheap supply
of them in Yedo. So he thought he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>take a supply over to Osaka and make
another great profit.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he spoke of this plan to his men
they were ready to go, for his sake.
Thereupon Bunkichi bought up a cargo
of salted salmon, and, putting it on board,
waited for the return of better weather.
Nor had he long to wait. As a reaction,
as it were, to the stormy westerly wind,
in a few days an east wind began to blow,
and, availing himself of the first opportunity,
he hoisted sail. He soon entered the
harbor of Osaka, and there he again made
a profit of tens of thousands of <i>rio</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every speculation he had planned was
crowned with success, and in little more
than a month he had amassed the enormous
sum of near upon a hundred thousand
<i>rio</i>. He was aided in this success
largely by the exertions of Kichidayu,
and gave him one thousand <i>rio</i> out of the
profit, while he handsomely rewarded
every one of the crew, who were all
greatly delighted at their good fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Kichidayu, taking his money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>with him as a present to his family, returned
to Sakai, his native town, where
he met again his dear wife and children
after his long absence, and then went
back to Osaka. Thence he accompanied
Bunkichi to Kumano-Ura.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Kumano the news of his safe arrival
at Yedo had been received at the Daikokuya
and by the townspeople with the
liveliest satisfaction. They had been
waiting eagerly for his return. Sure
enough, Bunkichi had come back on board
that very <i>Iurei-maru</i>, and the people,
whether they were personally known to
him or not, flocked round him with their
congratulations.</p>

<p class='c011'>From that day the master of the Daikokuya
treated him as his guest, while
the people of the town respected him as a
gentleman, and no one called him the
Wanizame-Kozo any more.</p>

<p class='c011'>On his arrival home Bunkichi recounted
all his transactions to the master of the
Daikokuya, and then went at once to the
merchants from whom he had bought the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>fruit that he sold in Yedo. “I thank you
for the cargo of oranges you sold me some
time ago at such a cheap price,” said he.
“I made a great profit by that cargo, but
I don’t like to be only a gainer myself
while you all are losing your money, so
I’ll give you double what I then paid you
for the oranges.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On account of this unexpected liberality
they were very grateful to him, and his
fame went abroad all over the province of
Kii, and everybody began to know him,
and whenever he wanted to invest in any
goods, he had no difficulty in getting all he
wished.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day came at last when Bunkichi
determined to go up to the great city of
Yedo to make his name famous in the
whole of Japan by trading on a large scale.
With this resolve, he negotiated with some
of the big merchants of Kumano as to
whether they would make a contract with
him to send up all their oranges and timber
to his shop as their only agency in
Yedo. As they were already under a debt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of obligation to him, every one of them
agreed to do his best to keep Bunkichi’s
store in Yedo well supplied. Bunkichi was
greatly rejoiced, and, on this occasion traveling
overland, he arrived at Yedo in due
time and established himself in the Hatcho-bori
district, under the name of Kinokuniya.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c018'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
This happened in the second year of
the Sho-o era (1653 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), when he was
nineteen years of age. Then he changed
his name Bunkichi into Bunzayemon (his
father’s name), and began to trade on a
large scale in timber and oranges from
Kishu, selling them to the whole city of
Yedo. Thus his prosperity increased.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f28'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r28'>28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>House of the Kino Kuni (country of Kii).</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One day a master carpenter, who had
the entrée to the house, came to see Bunzayemon,
saying: “I have come to consult
with you on a rather strange matter. How
would you like to engage a man for your
business?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it all depends on what kind of a
man he is,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is rather an eccentric sort of fellow.
If I tell you plainly about him there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>will be little chance of your employing
him; but the strange thing is that he
wishes me to do so. ‘If Bunzayemon will
employ me, good; if he will not employ me,
he is a fool, and I don’t want to be employed.’
Those were the very words he
said to me, and added, to my surprise:
‘As for you, if he hasn’t the sense to engage
me, you needn’t regret losing such a
customer as he is.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t wonder you were surprised,”
replied Bunzayemon; “but what has he
been hitherto?”</p>

<p class='c011'>To this question the carpenter replied:
“He is the second son in a warrior family;
but as far as I can see he is an idle, lazy
man. There are many of his kind in the
world, as you know; but he is rather an
extreme type of the class. He doesn’t
like to get up early nor to move about at
any time. In spite of his being dependent
on me for his support, he doesn’t hesitate
to demand to live in luxury. And then he
has the impudence to request me to recommend
him to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunzayemon meditated awhile and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>then said: “It’s rather interesting, what
you tell me. At all events, bring him
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you really mean to engage him?
You had better give him up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To which the merchant replied: “When
I see him I shall decide whether I shall
engage him or not. Bring him here
first!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Seihachi, the carpenter, went
home, fearing inwardly lest he should lose
his customer by bringing this man to Bunzayemon’s
notice, though he could not help
acceding to the man’s request.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a time Bunzayemon heard high
words in the front of the shop. One of
the voices he recognized as that of Seihachi,
who was exclaiming: “Chobei San,
you ought not to go in by the front door;
manners should compel you to go to the
back door. And don’t give yourself airs
here; if you do I shall be disgraced.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To this the other replied: “What are
you talking about? We are not dogs; why
should we go round to the kitchen?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>And so saying, the young man stalked up
to the shop called Kinokuniya, in spite of
Seihachi’s remonstrance, and asked somewhat
loudly: “Is the master at home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hearing him, Bunzayemon entered the
shop from the inner room.</p>

<p class='c011'>No sooner did Seihachi see him than he
began to apologize: “Master, I am more
sorry than I can tell you, and I beg your
pardon for this fellow’s rudeness.” As
he spoke he was holding Chobei by the
sleeve.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunzayemon, without heeding the
apology, civilly welcomed the strange
guest, saying: “Come in, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man stalked into the inner
room, while Seihachi, feeling like a fish
out of water, followed him. Bunzayemon
ushered the guests into one of the finest
rooms in his house. Seihachi was troubled
at heart, for the man’s clothes were
muddy, and said: “Sir, I fear we shall
soil your floor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Without even listening to Seihachi’s
words, or showing that he had heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>them, the host courteously said: “I am
Bunzayemon of the Kinokuniya; and what
is your name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My name is Chobei,” answered the
youth somewhat haughtily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Seihachi kept making signs to Chobei
as to his behavior, but the latter did not
take the least notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seihachi in his distress said to Bunzayemon:
“Please, sir, I beg your pardon
for his unmannerly behavior. I think he
must be a little out of his mind. I’m
sorry to have brought such a fellow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Bunzayemon and Chobei sat
with the <i>tabakobon</i><a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c018'><sup>[29]</sup></a> between them and
looked into each other’s face. For a
while neither of them spoke, while Seihachi,
whose trouble of mind was increased
by this state of affairs, tried to extricate
himself from this uncomfortable position
and said:</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f29'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r29'>29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A tobacco-tray.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Chobei San, we had better take our
leave now.” Then, turning to the host,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Sir, you won’t engage him after all, will
you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this Bunzayemon, speaking somewhat
loudly, said: “Oh, yes, I’ll engage
you, Chobei San, and take you on as one
of my men, if that is your wish.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then do you really engage me?”
And as he spoke Chobei quickly moved
backward a little and bowed to the floor,
in the act of showing respect and thanks
to his superior.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunzayemon then put on a lordly air
and asked him: “Chobei, are you skilled in
working the abacus?”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c018'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f30'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Chinese reckoning-board, consisting of beads or balls
strung on wires or rods set in a frame.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know much about it,” he replied,
as he placed both his hands on the
matting in the attitude of respect, “because
I was bred in a warrior family.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If that is so you’ll be of no use in the
shop,” said the master, scornfully. “What
can you do, then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>To which Chobei answered, “I know
how to turn a lot of money, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“That’s interesting!” replied the master.</p>

<p class='c011'>The carpenter, stricken dumb with astonishment
while the negotiation was going
on, said at last, when Chobei had gone,
“Sir, have you really engaged him? I
can’t tell you how relieved I am. I’ve
been greatly troubled by the thought that
I should be disgraced on account of him.
Please tell me why were you so civil to him
at first?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t understand, I see,” said
Bunzayemon, laughing. “Before I engaged
him he was my guest, and as he
belongs to the warrior class, his social
rank is entitled to consideration. But
when I have once engaged him, then I am
his master, and he is my servant, and I
must treat him accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see, I see,” said the carpenter.
“That is a fine way of looking at it. Well,
then, suppose I go to another man’s house,
I may act in a like haughty manner myself
before I get engaged!”</p>

<div id='i143'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i143.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Bunzayemon then put on a lordly air”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly; but if you do, you may get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>disliked instead of engaged”; at which reply
the carpenter was profoundly puzzled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early the next day the new employee
begged his master to advance him some
pocket money, which was promptly given
him; and having got it, off he went, no
one knew whither, and did not return even
for the midday meal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the other employees warned their
master, saying: “Sir, what is the use of
that sort of man? We don’t know where
he has come from. It’s really unsafe to
have that sort of fellow about the house,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the master paid no heed to their
warnings. “Not a bit of it! No matter
where his birthplace is, so long as the man
is worth having, my purpose is served. I
can see he has plenty of common sense,
and I’ll warrant he’ll be of good service
some day. Whenever you plan on a large
scale you must have good assistants: there
were four kindly men under Yoshisune,
the great general, and twenty-eight generals
under Shingen, the great lord of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>middle ages. Such men we look to for our
examples. Since the days of old every distinguished
man has attached to himself
able supporters. Merchants should do the
same, and, as certain as the day dawns,
success will come to the business man who
employs many good hands under him.
Wait and see. Chobei will do some noteworthy
things!” Thus he instructed his
servants in his principles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Toward the evening of that day Chobei
came back, but with a downcast countenance.
Bunzayemon did not ask where he
had been, nor did Chobei volunteer any information.
The next day again, and the
next, he asked for more money, and went
out early in the morning, coming back late
at night. He continued in this way for
about half a month. The others once more
warned their master, but he still refused
to listen to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day Chobei came to his master and
said: “Sir, you import a lot of timber
from Kii Province and try to sell it at once
among the people of this city. But Yedo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>is a place where fires are so frequent that,
if you buy up a lot of timber at a time when
the price is low and keep it, it’s certain
you will make a great profit when some
big fire occurs. But to find a good place
for keeping timber,” he went on, “is one
of the chief difficulties, because, as you are
well aware, if you keep it near at hand, in
the heart of the city, there’s danger of its
being destroyed by fire, and if you keep it
in a river or the sea, either it rots or is eaten
by worms. Now, every day I have been
going about looking for a good place to
keep it, and at last I have found one at
Kiba in Fukagawa. Keep timber in the
water of that place, and, on account of the
quality of the water, worms will not eat it,
but the wood will become shiny and improve
by keeping. Besides, no danger will
come to it from fire.” And he concluded
his far-sighted plan with, “For these reasons,
I hope you will soon construct a reservoir
for timber in that place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The master clapped his hands in admiration
and joy, saying: “Upon my word,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>that’s a capital idea! I thought you must
have been planning something, but I never
thought you were looking out for a place
to keep timber. I myself had turned the
matter over in my mind some time ago,
but on account of my many other duties I
hadn’t the time to see to it myself, and I
thank you for undertaking it for me.”
And then and there he intrusted the building
of the timber reservoir to Chobei.</p>

<p class='c011'>Chobei lost no time in going to Fukagawa
and buying ten thousand <i>tsubo</i>, or
about forty thousand square yards, of
ground near the temple of Susaki. He
built a large reservoir there and removed
to it all the timber imported by his master
from Kii Province. Besides, Chobei got
his master’s permission to send out men to
the neighboring mountains to buy up timber
where it could be got cheap, and having
deposited it all at Fukagawa, waited
contentedly for the time to sell.</p>

<div class='c017'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-i.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
IT was on the 18th of January
in the third year of the Meireki
era (1657 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) that a
bitterly cold north wind, much
colder than usual, was blowing hard. As
the wind increased in strength, the foot-passengers,
even in the busy streets, became
fewer. From the hour of <i>ne</i>, or the
snake, which is the same as ten o’clock
<span class='fss'>A.M.</span> in our modern reckoning, it had become
a regular hurricane, raising clouds
of dust and even whirling pebbles into the
air. It seemed as if the heavens and the
earth were creaking and shaking under
the rage of it. At this juncture the people
of the city were alarmed by the repeated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>hasty ringing of several fire-bells in the
direction of the Hongo district, the northern
part of the city. Everybody went up
to his fire-lookout and saw the ominous
black smoke rising in the shape of a vast
eddying cloud over the part of the city
called Maruyama in Hongo.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c018'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f31'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hongo precinct of the Maruyama Mountain.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It happened that, a few days before, Bunzayemon,
with five or six young men and
a plentiful supply of money, had gone into
the mountains of the neighboring country
to buy lumber, leaving the management of
his affairs, in his absence, entirely to Chobei
San.</p>

<p class='c011'>So when Chobei hurried up to the lookout
to ascertain where it was that the fire
had broken out, he glanced up to the heavens
and said to himself: “From the appearance
of the sky this wind will not fall
for some time, and in all probability the
whole city will be burned down, because
the houses are quite dried up by the continued
fine weather we have been having
lately. This is the time to save many people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>and it is also a very good time to make
a great deal of profit!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Saying this, Chobei made for the shop
and issued orders in excited haste to the
men. “Now, you men must form yourselves
into two bands: one to go straight
to Fukagawa and get a huge iron pot and
a quantity of rice to be boiled, and make
preparations for a charity lunch for the
poor; the other to stay here and put together
all the goods in the shop that we
may transfer them without loss of time
to Fukagawa.” Though the men complained
against his hasty decision to retreat
before the distant fire, they could not
resist the order of the chief man in the shop,
so they reluctantly began to pack up the
goods in preparation for departure, though
they thought it would only prove necessary
in the end to brush the dust and soot from
off them. Seeing how they were employed,
the neighbors, too, jeered at the hurry they
were in; but consternation soon spread
even among these neighbors when the
sparks, carried and fanned by the wind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>had started fresh fires—one at Kanda<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c018'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
and another at Nihonbashi, the business
part of the city.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f32'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A precinct of Yedo.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>By this time Chobei had already closed
the shop and sent off some valuables and
some furniture on carts to Fukagawa, escorted
by the men of the shop, while he
had all the timber floated down the river
to the same place, to be put with the other
timber which had already been stored
there. Chobei was much delighted to find
that all the preparations for the charity
luncheon for the destitute had been carried
out by those who had gone before them.
“For our first work is the saving of the
people,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>So saying, he engaged a few coolies to
assist the men in boiling the rice and so
forth. Having wrapped the boiled rice in
broad bamboo leaves, together with pickled
<i>daikon</i>,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c018'><sup>[33]</sup></a> he contrived a luncheon for
many thousands of the poor in no time.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f33'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Large white radishes.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The stronger the wind grew the farther
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the fire spread: it devastated the city
with such rapidity that noontide of that
day saw even the districts of Hachobori
and Shiba reduced to heaps of smoldering
ashes. Those who were burned out had
not had time to put away their furniture,
but only escaped with their lives, and
were seeking in vain to find shelter in the
houses of their relatives, who had suffered
a like fate with them and could not assist
them. Not knowing where to turn, they
wandered about in terror the whole day,
and their misery was such that they
could not even get themselves food.</p>

<p class='c011'>While this was the state of things, a
band of coolies came among them with a
rectangular bamboo basket with <i>bento</i><a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c018'><sup>[34]</sup></a> in
it, and one of them held aloft a paper flag
with huge characters on it, which read
as follows: “Kinokuniya Bunzayemon’s
Charity Luncheon!”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f34'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r34'>34</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Luncheon.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The coolies distributed this <i>bento</i>
among the men and women who were in
distress. Every man and woman, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>whether young or old, who was sore
oppressed by hunger, was glad to get hold
of this food and was relieved by it, though
it was only for a time. With admirable
sagacity Chobei quickly hired many more
coolies and prepared more luncheons,
sending them to every quarter of the city;
and so wherever men went they saw the
selfsame flag flying for charity, and the
whole city was surprised, and praised the
generosity of this Kinokuniya Bunzayemon.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this great fire even those large palaces
of the <i>daimios</i>,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c018'><sup>[35]</sup></a> which stood in the
line of the fire and which could in ordinary
days call up many hands to keep the fire
off, were not able to escape from the disaster.
Even the nobles of high rank and
their retainers knew not where to find
shelter, but stood bewildered in the corners
of their big gardens and waited for help,
but in vain. For such personages Chobei
ordered men to prepare <i>bento</i> in nice packages
of <i>sasaori</i><a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c018'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and to present it to those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>nobles and their households in the name
of Kinokuniya Bunzayemon. In consequence,
even the servants of these nobles
were grateful to the coolies, and received
the presents on behalf of their masters.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f35'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r35'>35</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Feudal lords, or the nobility of Japan.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f36'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Boxes made with bamboo leaves.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Then, too, Chobei ordered the men of
Kinokuniya to put up wooden inclosures
round about the grounds of those nobles
to protect them from robbery or trespass.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fire raged through the whole night
of the 18th and through the whole of the
next day, so Chobei engaged yet more
coolies, and ordered them to make more
charity <i>bento</i> for the relief of the poor.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a certain man named Kamada
Matahachi, who was well known for
his physical strength. He had always kept
a large portable closet, about six feet by
three, and five feet seven inches in height,
in which to carry his furniture in case of
fire. When he thought his house was in
danger, he put all his belongings into this
box, placed a sheet of matting on the top,
and carried all these on his back by the
means of a rope specially prepared for the
purpose. Carrying a long, heavy stick in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>his hand, he walked unconcernedly and
steadily among the crowd like an elephant
among dogs. Every one marveled at his
size and strength, and was forced to make
room for him to go by. When he came to
Fukagawa to escape from the fire, he saw
there a large sign which read:</p>

<p class='c023'>Day laborers are wanted for carrying the
charity <i>bento</i>. Let all who wish to be engaged
call at the timber reservoir of Kinokuniya Bunzayemon
at Fukagawa. Three meals will be
given, and one <i>kwan mon</i><a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c018'><sup>[37]</sup></a> will be paid daily
for wages.</p>

<div class='footnote c024' id='f37'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r37'>37</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A sum about equal to one dollar.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As he had nowhere to go at the time,
he was glad to find some work. He
went to the timber reservoir of Bunzayemon,
where he found a bustle and hurry
of men and women, hundreds in number,
for the preparation of luncheon. Some
were preparing a quantity of rice in large
iron pots, others were cutting up some
pickles, while a third set of men were
wrapping these up in bamboo leaves.</p>

<div id='i157'  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>
<img src='images/i157.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Matahachi in the great fire at Yedo</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Many bands of coolies with their paper
flags were carrying out the luncheons in
the baskets, while others were coming
back with empty ones.</p>

<p class='c011'>Matahachi, with that big closet on his
back, drew near to the place and thundered
out: “Is this the place where hands are
wanted?” The people turned, and without
giving any answer simply looked at
one another in astonishment at his curious
appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more he called out: “I’m one
Kamada Matahachi; I come to assist your
charity work for the rescue of the people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The voice apparently penetrated even to
the inner room, for Chobei came out and
was also surprised by the man’s appearance,
but said: “Nothing can be more fortunate
for us than to have the assistance
of Mr. Matahachi, who is noted in the
whole of Yedo for his physical strength.
Please help us in our work by distributing
the <i>bento</i> in this big, light-wood chest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With ready acquiescence Matahachi
laid aside the heavy baggage on his back.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“This is my furniture,” he said; “please
keep it for me.” The rattling sound of
iron and china in the chest made those
near by wonder at the forethought with
which he had made provision against the
contingency of a fire, and by which he
had been enabled to move away at once
with all his household goods.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having safely stowed away his possessions,
Matahachi lifted the big wooden
chest, now packed with <i>bento</i>, and by
means of a rope put it on his back, and,
holding the big pole of hard oak-wood
in his right hand and the paper flag in his
left, started forth to the scene of ruin, with
one coolie to assist him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he called out in a loud, deep tone of
voice to announce the charity, the people
turned to him in astonishment and soon
came flocking around him. The attendant
coolie, standing behind, distributed
the <i>bento</i> from the chest on Matahachi’s
back with no inconvenience. So these two
finished their task in less time than it
would have taken five or six men to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>it with ordinary methods. On their way
back to Kinokuniya, when they came to
a crowded place Matahachi put forth his
staff, and by pushing the crowd to one side
made his way through without any hindrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one of those crowded places he heard
the shrieking cry of a girl. Forcing his
way to the spot, he found a girl of twelve
or thirteen years of age who could not get
up on account of being trodden down by
the crowd. Being naturally of a chivalrous
character, he soon helped the girl up
and asked whether she had not her parents
with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sobbed, and said: “We all ran
away when the fire broke out, and I became
separated from my parents!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he could not leave her there, he said:
“That cannot be helped. If you wander
about here you may be trampled to death.
I will take you to a better place if you will
get into my empty chest.” So the coolie
helped her in, and they hastened on to Fukagawa.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>At another time he saw an old woman
of about threescore years, half dead, lying
by the wayside with her dress partly
burned. He felt he could not leave her
behind in such a state, so she, too, was put
into the bamboo basket by the side of the
girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having got back to Fukagawa, he said
to Chobei: “I rescued these two on the
way home. Give them the treatment which
is suited to their need.” He handed them
over to the acting master, who thanked
Matahachi, and thus addressed the other
bands of coolies: “To give away the
<i>bento</i> alone does not cover the whole work
of charity; whenever any of you are
coming back with empty chests, you, too,
had better bring people home, if such help
is needed as these two received.” And a
cordial reception was given to the old woman
as well as to the young girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>During such a fire there were naturally
many lost children and aged persons who
might have been trodden down under foot.
Having understood Chobei’s instructions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the other bands from that time were sure
to bring back two or three who needed
help. To any who were thus brought in
Chobei gave proper treatment, and as he
gave the coolies prizes they worked with
great zeal and diligence. Kamada Matahachi
went in and out of the fire ruins
many times a day and repeated the same
charitable work. The five or six hundred
coolies did their best, also, and, in consequence,
at the reservoir there was a continuous
trooping out with the <i>bento</i> and
trooping in of the people; and by the night
of the 19th there were 2800 rescued persons,
old and young, all told, who had
been brought to this temporary shelter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even on the night of the 19th there was
no sign of the abating of the fire. The
strong northwest wind was still raging,
and within two days, the Hongo, Kanda,
Nihonbashi, Kyobashi, and Shiba districts
were all swept by the fire. And now the
fire was burning down Takanawa with
such terrific force that the very sea-line
seemed to recede before it. But that night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the wind suddenly changed to the south-east,
and the fire turned backward and
licked up all the houses on both sides of the
great river Sumida and those that had survived
at first in Asakusa and round about
Yushima. Then at last it was got under
control near to Senju about noonday on the
20th. And since the morning of the 18th,
within three days and two nights, the
whole city of Yedo had been reduced to
ashes and as many as 108,000 people were
lost. It was one of the most terrible of
fires.</p>

<p class='c011'>Indeed, such a disastrous fire had never
before and has never since occurred in
Yedo, and even now it is sadly referred to
by the people as the “Furisode-Kwaji”—the
long-sleeved fire—quite as often as it
is called the great fire of Hongo-Maruyama.</p>

KINOKUNIYA BUNZAYEMON,
who unknowingly had
left such a big fire behind him
and sought the mountainous
districts of the neighboring provinces as
his field of action, went over to Sagami
Province the same day, and negotiated
with the chief owners of forests there and
made a contract with them, paying them
guaranty money in advance. The next day
he crossed over to Awa Province and visited
in turn the owners of mountain forests
in Kazusa, Shimo-osa, and Musashi, and
struck bargains with them to buy all their
salable timber. Four or five days only
were occupied in these rapid negotiations,
at the end of which time, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>rumor of the big fire of Yedo had got
abroad to these neighboring provinces,
Kibun hastened on his way back to
Yedo. As he was passing amidst the
smoldering ruins on the way to his depot
at Fukagawa, he continually heard the
people talking of himself. Every time he
stopped and listened. “Well, Genbei San,
Kinokuniva Bunzayemon is a fine fellow,
isn’t he? One would think he had foreseen
the fire and prepared that enormous
amount of <i>bento</i> beforehand; otherwise
he could not possibly have given it out to
the people so readily. I and others had nowhere
to find food, so we supported ourselves
for three days on that <i>bento</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that so, Hachibei San? I also received
it every day. For three days,
wherever one went among the ruins one
was met with his charity. It’s said that
within three days no less than two thousand
<i>koku</i><a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c018'><sup>[38]</sup></a> of rice were given away.
Had it not been for that charity nearly
the whole population of the city would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>have famished. Moreover, Genbei San,
the charity was extended even to the mansions
of many <i>daimios</i>, and the nobles and
their families ate of his <i>bento</i>.”</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f38'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r38'>38</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ten thousand bushels.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“To be sure. Even the nobles with
their heaps of gold and all their power
couldn’t buy a single grain in the general
consternation! Really that Kibun, whoever
he may be, is a sagacious fellow!”
Thus the men talked who had received his
alms.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Bunzayemon, who listened to this
current talk, was inwardly rejoicing that
Chobei had managed his affairs so admirably,
he passed two women who were
talking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Haru San, when I lost sight of
my child in the crowd,” one of them was
saying, “I became almost mad in my
search for her; but as I could not find her
in the hurry and bustle, I gave her up for
being trodden to death or else for being
suffocated in the heat. In my grief I lost
all care for my own life. But then I heard
the people say that some thousands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>strayed children had been taken to Kibun’s
country place at Fukagawa. I ran there
at once, and lo! I found my little girl there
among the children. My joy, of course,
knew no bounds. Let people say what they
wish, Kibun must be a merciful man; in
such a fire as this naturally there are a lot
of strayed children, and therefore he sent
out his men to every quarter of the city,
ordering them to bring such to his house.
In three days a thousand or more people
were rescued, they say. Henceforth I will
always have a niche for Kibun Sama in my
heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will, too. Your case was not so bad
as mine. For my part, when I lost sight of
my mother, no words could express my
anxiety. If she had been in sound health, I
would have felt a little easier, but she has
been laid up since last winter on account of
her great age. At first we thought we were
safe from the conflagration, as the fire
had passed by us toward Takanawa; but
then by the change of wind the sparks
started the fire afresh at the very next door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>to our own. The men belonging to the
house had gone to Takanawa to help a
relative of ours there, and I thought it
would be a shame to me if by my indecision
the fire should cause the death of my
mother; so, holding mother’s hand, I
dragged her from the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After two or three <i>chos’</i><a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c018'><sup>[39]</sup></a> run, mother
was out of breath and consequently
couldn’t walk a step farther. I put her on
my back and ran on, but we were both soon
suffocated by the smoke, and then I tumbled
down. I couldn’t get up for some
time because other people who were running
to escape from the flames trod on me.</p>

<div class='footnote c019' id='f39'>
<p class='c020'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One <i>cho</i> equals about one hundred and twenty yards.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“In another minute the sparks set fire
to my dress and my whole body was nearly
burned. However, I braced myself up
and got on my feet, being very anxious
about my mother. I looked round, and she
was not there. I knew she couldn’t possibly
have run away, owing to her helplessness;
so I looked around me, being
sure she must be either in a ditch or stupefied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>by the smoke. The fire, however,
was too quick for me. I couldn’t stay to
make further search, so I ran away. I
have been weeping since at the thought
of mother’s death, when yesterday I heard
a report that mother was safe at Fukagawa.
I flew to the place and met her.
When I asked how she had got there she
told me that she had been rescued by the
coolies of a certain Kibun, and after being
brought there had received the most kind
treatment. Henceforth I’ll not sleep with
my feet toward Fukagawa.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hearing this, Bunzayemon was further
struck by the excellent management of
Chobei. On his way home through the
desolation and ruin he also passed by many
of the <i>daimios’</i> palace-grounds, when he
saw his own trade-mark on all the boardings
put up as temporary inclosures.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he was wondering at this new proof
of Chobei’s energy and wisdom, two <i>samurai</i>,
or retainers, came by talking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look, my friend! The inclosure of
this mansion, too, seems to have been put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>up by Kibun’s people. The man is wonderfully
ready for everything! And no
doubt the fact that he has put up the temporary
inclosure means that the rebuilding
will be put into his hands, and no better
man could probably be found.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right. If we employ him he’s
certain to lose no time about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunzayemon, who overheard this conversation,
clapped his hands in admiration,
and, turning to his attendants, said:
“How now, my fellows! You didn’t
think much of Chobei at first, did you?
Well, what do you think of him now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The attendants looked at one another
and said: “Really, he is very clever—even
more clever than you, sir! Yes, unless a
man employs some men cleverer than himself
he can never become great!”</p>

<p class='c011'>With unbounded joy Bunzayemon soon
arrived at his depot at Fukagawa. No
sooner did he catch sight of Chobei than
he held out his hand to him, saying: “Ah!
I have no words in which to express my
thanks to you. I have been hearing from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the chance talk of the people on my way
home of all you have been doing in my absence,
and have been much struck by your
sagacity. Indeed, I have never felt so
much joy as I experience to-day!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunzayemon, who was not accustomed
to show joy or sorrow in his face, could
not suppress his emotion on that day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost all the houses in the city of Yedo
were destroyed by the fire. Warriors and
merchants had to build their abodes
afresh, and because all the timber in the
city was reduced to ashes, the price at once
went up tenfold. Now Kibun alone, at
this juncture, had already a great stock
of timber on hand at his depot at Fukagawa,
and he had fresh supplies constantly
being sent in from the mountains in the
near-by country, being the timber he had
lately bought. The profit which he
gained by selling all this material was
something enormous.</p>

<div id='i173'  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
<img src='images/i173.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“‘I have no words in which to express my thanks to you’”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, on account of his alms and
the inclosures he had put up for various
great feudal lords, they too became his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>customers and asked him to rebuild their
mansions. By these orders he again made
a great profit. He ascribed this good fortune
entirely to Chobei, to whom he gave
a great sum of money as a token of
appreciation of his services. Besides, he
handsomely rewarded the other men and
boys in his employ.</p>

<p class='c011'>He also sent for that chief carpenter,
Seihachi.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Seihachi, this is the prize which
I give you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus saying, he put a box which contained
one thousand <i>rio</i> in front of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The other was frightened out of his
wits.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! do you say there’s a gift of a
thousand <i>rio</i> for me in this packet? Isn’t
it empty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, it’s not empty. Lift it and see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whereupon Seihachi tried to lift it and
said: “Truly, it’s too heavy; I can’t lift
it! Isn’t this a dream?” said he, as he
pinched his knee.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunzayemon laughed. “It is not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>dream. It’s a reward to you, sure and
certain, and you had better take it home
with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Really, I thank you, sir. In the time
of the fire I carried charity <i>bento</i> only
three times, for I was working at other
things; therefore I’m not worthy of so
great a reward!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t a reward for that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then for the inclosure which I did for
Sendai Sama, the <i>daimio</i>; for that work
my assistants came late, so I couldn’t finish
it till late in the evening. The work
ought to have been finished much earlier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t for that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not for that, either? For what is it,
then, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunzayemon pointed to Chobei, who
was then in the shop, and said: “You
brought me that excellent article, there.
It’s for that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The carpenter misunderstood him and
said: “Is that so? I see, for that article.
That’s an article rarely found, and I
thought it would be a great loss if it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>burnt, so before other things I sent it
down on a raft from Hachobori to Fukagawa.
Then on the way it collided with a
ship and the raft was nearly broken to
pieces.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean that hinoki plank, do you
not, of eight inches both in breadth and
thickness?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; you don’t understand me, yet. It
is your prize for bringing Chobei to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean Chobei San. Ah, I see, I
see! I did not understand you. I wondered
why you gave me such a handsome
reward. But Chobei San has certainly
proved to be an excellent man. I thought
he was a hopeless fellow. Shall I bring
you another Chobei San? I have a lot
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What sort of Chobei is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The next idlest fellow who depends
on me for support.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bunzayemon laughed, saying, “No,
thank you; I don’t want another Chobei
of that kind.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>In this wise, Bunzayemon, by the help
of Chobei, undertook various important
schemes and accumulated great wealth.
Thus in time his fame had sounded
through the whole of Japan and he had
built a big establishment at Honhachobori,—a
street in Tokio, near the heart of the
city,—which covered one <i>cho</i> square. Always
strenuously pushing forward his
business, he at last, as had been his ambition,
became the leading merchant in the
whole of Japan. As the old verse says:</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
